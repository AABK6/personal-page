Closing Session - 2025-26 SCUP Projects Announcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAXUfFgbGA,10 hours ago,4 views,"## The Paris Peace Forum's Wager: Can Concrete Projects Bridge a Fractured World Order?

The closing session of the Paris Peace Forum articulated a profound tension between the aspirational architecture of global governance and the brutal realities it increasingly fails to contain. By juxtaposing the forum’s “sanitized walls” with the “rubble of Gaza,” the opening address framed the central challenge not merely as a set of discrete crises, but as a systemic crisis of legitimacy for the entire post-war liberal order. The session revealed the Forum’s core thesis: that in an era of institutional paralysis, the path to renewing multilateralism lies not in grand pronouncements, but in fostering a distributed ecosystem of concrete, impact-oriented projects and targeted multi-stakeholder coalitions.

The session’s most potent provocation came from Trisha Shetty, President of the Steering Committee, who invoked author Arundhati Roy to suggest that the debris of Western liberal democracy itself lies buried under the destruction in Gaza. This framing immediately elevated the discussion beyond technical problem-solving to a fundamental questioning of the current order’s moral and political coherence, a concern amplified by references to under-reported conflicts in Sudan and Congo. This stark diagnosis of systemic failure was later complemented by a philosophical intervention from UN Global Advocate for Peace, Maryam Bukar Hassan. Her poetic address redefined peace not as a final political destination, but as a ""messy,"" continuous, and deliberate human practice of rebuilding and understanding—a process built ""brick by brutal brick,"" often by women, in the aftermath of state-level failure.

In response to this grim context, the forum’s proposed innovations centered on method rather than grand strategy. Director General Justin Vaissé articulated a vision of impact-driven governance, shifting focus from academic ""pontificating"" to tangible outcomes. This was demonstrated through several concrete initiatives launched or advanced during the forum. A summit on information integrity culminated in 29 nations signing a declaration framing information as a ""public good,"" backed by financial commitments to protect it. Similarly, the forum facilitated targeted coalitions to address specific global challenges, such as preparing the ground for a global agreement on methane and launching the I-RAISE initiative to govern the impact of AI on children. The core of this model, however, was the ""Scale-up Project"" (SCUP) initiative, which showcased ten ventures receiving tailored support. These projects—ranging from an AI-powered agricultural watch for Africa to a disinformation radar for the Balkans and a chatbot for survivors of gender-based violence in South Africa—represent a strategy of outsourcing governance solutions to a portfolio of agile, ground-level actors.

The dominant fault line exposed was not a direct debate between speakers but the inherent chasm between the forum's pragmatic, project-based optimism and the accelerating fragmentation of the geopolitical landscape. The assertion that the world faces more conflicts than at any time since 1946 hangs over the proceedings, creating a fundamental debate about the efficacy of the forum's model. While the platform champions a ""multi-actor"" approach to bypass the gridlock of institutions like the United Nations, it implicitly accepts the dysfunction of the core system. The presented solutions are designed to work *around* great power vetos and institutional sclerosis, rather than directly confronting the need for fundamental reform of bodies like the UN Security Council.

What proved unexpected was the session’s unvarnished emotional and political honesty, particularly Shetty’s direct challenge to the credibility of the Western-led order. This candor shifted the tone from a self-congratulatory closing to a sobering call to action. The session's principal blind spot, however, was the lack of critical examination of its own proposed model. The strategy of incubating a network of non-state and sub-state solutions, while valuable, was presented as an unalloyed good. There was no interrogation of its potential limitations: whether this project-based approach can truly scale to address systemic drivers of conflict, or if it risks becoming a palliative that distracts from the more difficult work of reforming the foundational, yet broken, institutions of global power.

The strategic implication of this session is that the Paris Peace Forum is positioning itself not as a simple convener but as an incubator for a parallel form of multilateralism. It is making a wager that the most viable path for global governance is no longer top-down institutional reform, but the cultivation of a resilient, bottom-up ecosystem of specific, measurable, and scalable solutions to global problems."
PPF2025: Closing Press Conference,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rZxDtCCslY,10 hours ago,4 views,"## From Norm-Setting to Action: The Paris Peace Forum's Closin Press Conference

The closing press conference of the 2025 Paris Peace Forum revealed an institution grappling with its own methodology in a world beset by interlocking crises. The discussions crystallized a central tension: the ambition for multi-stakeholder solutions confronts the reality of geopolitical fragmentation, climate overshoot, and a degraded information environment. Consequently, the Forum’s primary output is not grand consensus but a portfolio of targeted, action-oriented coalitions, betting that specific governance tools can build resilience against a backdrop of systemic decay.

The Forum's agenda, as summarized by its Director General Justin Vaïsse, spanned the critical axes of peace, planetary health, and governance, yet the most tangible outcomes emerged from the latter. While climate discussions focused on accelerating implementation post-Paris Agreement—notably on methane and critical minerals—it was the high-level conference on information integrity that produced the most concrete provocation. Sir Mark Thompson detailed the ""Paris Declaration,"" a multilateral commitment by 29 states to treat access to reliable, independent media as a public good requiring sustained state support. This declaration moves beyond rhetoric by anchoring its purpose in financial action, specifically through renewed and expanded funding for the International Fund for Public Interest Media (IFPIM), including a new €10 million commitment from France and Ghana's accession as the first African state donor. The initiative thus represents a direct state-backed countermove in what Thompson termed the global ""battle between information and misinformation.""

The Forum's core intellectual proposition lies in its ""multi-actor method,"" a deliberate shift from traditional multilateralism. Vaïsse framed this as an incubator for ""pre-norms"" and policy convergence, bringing together not just heads of state but the operational officials, civil society actors, and private sector players capable of driving implementation. This approach was exemplified in the peace pillar, which highlighted a civil society-led initiative to maintain momentum for a two-state solution in the Middle East, decoupling it from stalled high-level diplomacy. Similarly, the focus on AI for development in the Global South seeks to reorient the technology race away from perfecting large language models and toward creating concrete use cases for agriculture, health, and education, thereby turning a geopolitical competition into a development opportunity.

The question-and-answer session exposed the inherent fractures in the global governance landscape. A significant fault line appeared between the democratization of information and the collapse of journalistic standards. Both Vaïsse and Thompson acknowledged the dilemma, celebrating the inclusion of new voices like content creators while underscoring the vital need to fund professional media as a bulwark against the erosion of a ""shared reality."" Further tensions arose over the Forum's strategic focus, with a pointed question on the absence of a dedicated session on Sudan exposing the political calculations and capacity limits inherent in agenda-setting. This debate underscored a broader methodological challenge: how a forum dedicated to global peace selects which ""forgotten conflicts"" to remember. The discussion on Ukraine also revealed a potential gap between the Forum’s focus on political and military support versus the demand for international justice and accountability mechanisms.

Unexpected moments of candor offered a glimpse into the Forum's self-awareness. Vaïsse’s open admission of ""regret"" over the lack of a Sudan-focused panel was a departure from the curated messaging typical of such events. This transparency, coupled with his expressed ""conflict"" over the rise of unregulated content creators, suggested a leadership wrestling with the complexities of its mission. The principal blind spot, however, may be the Forum's intrinsic preference for governance solutions over the harder-edged instruments of international law. A question concerning international justice for Ukraine highlighted that while the Forum excels at building coalitions to manage crises and regulate new technologies, it appears less equipped to address the fundamental questions of legal culpability and enforcement that underpin a rules-based order. The multi-stakeholder model, by its nature, may favor the negotiated over the adjudicated.

In an era of dysfunctional global institutions, the Paris Peace Forum is strategically positioning itself as an incubator for practical, targeted interventions rather than a platform for universal consensus. The clear emphasis on funding independent media and shaping AI governance signals a bet that strengthening the informational and technological pillars of democracy is the most viable path to resilience. The strategic implication is a subtle redefinition of peacemaking: less about resolving state-on-state conflict directly, and more about equipping societies with the governance tools to withstand a world of perpetual crisis."
From Waste to Resources: Circular Solutions for People and Planet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAs6y3c88_0,4 days ago,70 views,"## The Dual Nature of Circular Economy: Green Ideals Versus Industrial Imperatives in a Changing World

The Paris Peace Forum's panel on circular solutions, themed ""From Waste to Resources,"" revealed a complex, often contrasting, understanding of the circular economy's practical implementation. While lauded as an innovative pathway to address environmental degradation and foster sustainable development, the discussions underscored a fundamental tension between its aspirational green ideals and the gritty realities of industrial processes, policy challenges, and entrenched societal perceptions. The panel illuminated how localized, community-driven initiatives in the Global South offer tangible models for inclusive growth, even as global experts highlighted the systemic shifts required to integrate circularity into established economies and confront its ""heavy, dirty industry"" facade.

At the grassroots level, particularly in the Global South, circular solutions are actively transforming environmental burdens into direct socio-economic benefits. Grâce Sandrine Zancran of NGO Jevev detailed the ""Jacinthe d'eau"" project in Benin, where the invasive water hyacinth, a persistent ecological threat in Lake Nokoué impacting local fishing livelihoods, is being valorized. By transforming the plant into organic compost and artisanal eco-products, the initiative not only mitigates an environmental challenge but also generates green jobs for women and youth, strengthens social cohesion, and stimulates ecotourism, demonstrating a potent link between ecosystem restoration and community empowerment. Similarly, Sourav Rimal of the KarmaYog Foundation in Nepal showcased the upcycling of discarded materials—tires, plastics, and metals—into safe and inclusive playgrounds for community schools. Beyond providing recreational spaces, this project critically addresses Nepal's job scarcity, creating over 500 green jobs and allowing families to remain within their communities rather than seeking precarious labor abroad. These examples underscore how tailored, local interventions can directly convert waste into tangible resources that bolster livelihoods and build resilience.

However, a broader, more nuanced perspective emerged regarding the systemic integration of circularity into national and global economies. Bruno Oberle, President of the World Resources Forum, delineated critical conditions for the circular economy's effective contribution to environmental and socio-economic goals. He emphasized that the impact of recycling is directly proportional to the existing ""anthropic stock"" of natural resources—buildings, engines, and consumer goods—which is substantially larger in the Global North, making recycling more impactful there. While organic waste management has a universal, traditional circularity, the broader application in the Global South is limited by nascent industrial infrastructure. Oberle further argued that true circularity necessitates not just recycling, but a fundamental reshaping of value chains and a re-evaluation of product needs, moving from ownership to service models (e.g., car-sharing). He noted that while such behavioral and structural changes are challenging in developed nations due to established systems, developing economies possess a unique advantage: the opportunity ""from the beginning to work in a different way,"" unburdened by legacy infrastructure.

The discussion also confronted the less glamorous realities of industrial-scale circularity and the critical need for policy frameworks and technological innovation. Vadym Shchokin from Ukraine's Research Mining Institute presented cutting-edge technology developed to drastically reduce dust and gas emissions from industrial explosions, a common byproduct of mining, illustrating how technological advancements can mitigate environmental impacts within heavy industries. Yet, this ambition clashes with the perception challenge highlighted by both Sourav Rimal and Bruno Oberle: ""waste"" and ""upcycling"" often carry negative connotations, impacting community acceptance and government support. Oberle bluntly characterized industrial recycling as ""heavy, dirty industry"" that often involves low wages and faces ""not in my backyard"" opposition. This stark reality necessitates robust policy interventions, including pricing virgin materials above recycled ones through taxes or subsidies, enforcing mandatory recycled content percentages in products, and strategic land-use planning to accommodate these essential but often undesirable industrial sites. Ultimately, the successful transition to a circular economy hinges on a collective commitment to overcome these perceptual and systemic barriers through education, advocacy, and strategic investments.

The strategic implication is clear: the path to a truly circular global economy is neither uniform nor solely dependent on technological breakthroughs. It demands a sophisticated understanding of localized contexts, recognizing the differing capacities and opportunities between the Global North and South. Critically, it necessitates a concerted effort to shift public perception of waste into a valuable resource, underpinned by policy mechanisms that incentivize circularity throughout value chains and investment in the ""heavy, dirty"" but indispensable industries that drive resource recovery. Without an integrated approach that addresses these economic, social, and political dimensions, the transformative potential of the circular economy will remain largely unfulfilled."
"Empowering Youth to Lead Peacebuilding, Social Change, and Cohesion",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWxDY5jB9QQ,4 days ago,54 views,"## Reimagining Peace: Youth Agency and Holistic Resilience in a Poly-Crisis World

The Paris Peace Forum’s session on empowering youth for peacebuilding, social change, and cohesion offered a vital counter-narrative to the prevailing global pessimism. While acknowledging a world grappling with escalating conflicts, fracturing multilateral systems, and shifting geopolitical plates, the panelists underscored a powerful truth: beneath the surface of global instability, grassroots actors, particularly youth, are actively forging innovative solutions that transcend traditional, often rigid, humanitarian frameworks. This discussion revealed a compelling vision for peacebuilding, one centered on radical listening, holistic engagement, and the inherent capacity of communities to drive their own transformational change.

A primary tension highlighted throughout the session was the persistent disconnect between externally driven aid paradigms and the organic needs articulated by local populations. Muhammad Adam from the Youth and Environment Society vividly recounted how, even amidst Sudan's peak conflict, a comprehensive survey revealed education, not immediate sustenance, as the primary need for young people, followed by cessation of hostilities and then basic provisions. This directly challenges the typical humanitarian response, which often designs interventions based on donor mandates rather than granular local consultations. Adam stressed that youth, while often the primary victims of conflict—exacerbated by climate-induced resource scarcity and competition—must be recognized as the primary agents of their countries' reconstruction, demanding that they ""decide what the best for them."" Dogu David Justin Ngamunde, representing the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative in conflict-ridden South Sudan, reinforced this imperative, describing how their ""Youth Peacemaker Network"" (YPN) is designed to ""elevate their engagement"" by contextualizing interventions to meet specific community needs, directly involving young people in mapping, prioritizing, and formulating local solutions.

The panelists consistently advocated for a multi-faceted approach to peacebuilding, recognizing the intricate web of challenges faced by fragile communities. Adam articulated a vicious cycle where active conflict deepens resource scarcity, amplifying climate change impacts, which in turn fuels further competition and social fragmentation, echoing the climate-driven roots of conflicts like the one in Darfor. In response, Ngamunde detailed YPN’s four-pillar strategy, encompassing peacebuilding (conflict resolution training for youth leaders who then cascade knowledge), business and entrepreneurship (translating peace skills into livelihoods), health and well-being (trauma healing), and sports (as a platform for social cohesion). This holistic framework underscores a critical shift from siloed humanitarian aid—which often fails to address the underlying causes of instability—to integrated programs that build tangible ""peace dividends"" and foster long-term community resilience.

Angela Yoder Maina from the Green String Network powerfully reframed the global mental health crisis, arguing that it is not merely a consequence of conflict zones but a universal challenge that demands a radical rethinking of support systems. Drawing on personal experience in Kenya and recalling the failure of institutional help for young people in crisis, she critiqued the inadequacy of conventional mental health services, especially in settings where access to hospitals, beds, or therapists is nonexistent. Instead, Maina's organization champions ""healing-centered peacebuilding"" by leveraging existing community bonds to prevent individuals from being ""alone in crisis."" Through visual storytelling—using hundreds of watercolor paintings from the region—her programs create safe spaces for participants to share deeply personal experiences of pain, hurt, joy, and liberation. This artistic engagement fosters a collective understanding that transcends individual suffering, allowing people to reclaim agency over their healing journeys.

Ultimately, the forum underscored that genuine peacebuilding and sustainable development emanate from empowering local actors, particularly youth, to own their future. The success of initiatives like YALAP’s “cash for work” programs, which saw participation quadruple, and Green String’s self-sustaining community healing circles, demonstrates that investing in human capital, skill development, and endogenous support networks yields transformative results, irrespective of external funding fluctuations. The strategic implication is clear: international policy and donor strategies must pivot from prescriptive, top-down interventions to genuinely collaborative models. By prioritizing radical listening, nurturing youth agency, and embracing holistic, culturally resonant approaches—including arts and sports—the global community can empower local populations to construct durable peace from within, fostering resilience against the intertwined challenges of conflict, climate change, and mental health. This necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of engagement, recognizing that the most potent solutions are often found in the communities themselves, requiring only platforms and genuine partnership to flourish."
Feeding Human Capital through Global Commitments and Action,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPeBbkkXIVg,4 days ago,36 views,"## Beyond Band-Aids: Scaling Solutions for Global Malnutrition Amidst Shrinking Resources

The urgent and persistent global challenge of malnutrition demands a paradigm shift, moving beyond fragmented, short-term aid to integrated, scalable, and sustainably financed solutions across diverse sectors. Convening at the Paris Peace Forum, a panel of experts underscored that while the scale of human suffering and economic loss is staggering, proven interventions and strategic pathways exist to transform global food systems and unlock human potential. The central tension revealed was the critical need for cohesive, long-term strategies and innovative financing amidst shrinking traditional aid budgets, pushing for both strategic coordination and market-driven approaches.

The alarming scale and profound hidden costs of malnutrition continue to undermine global progress, stifling individual potential and national development. Dr. David Laborde of the FAO painted a stark picture, revealing that 673 million people suffer from chronic hunger, 2.1 billion are food insecure, and a staggering 2.6 billion cannot afford a healthy diet. This widespread malnutrition, as Paul Newnham from the SDG2 Advocacy Hub emphasized, is more than just a lack of calories; it represents a denial of ""opportunity, memories, emotion, dignity, and love"" for billions. Laborde further articulated the economic burden, attributing an annual 10% loss of global GDP to inefficient agri-food systems, with two-thirds stemming from poor diets and the associated cost to human capital. The persistence of malnutrition is multifaceted, rooted in structural economic inequality, exacerbated by climate and conflict shocks, and compounded by insufficient access to healthy food environments. This creates a ""double burden"" where individuals can suffer from both under- and over-nutrition within their lifetimes. Addressing this multifaceted challenge demands not just humanitarian intervention, but a systemic re-evaluation of how food systems interact with health, economy, and peace.

Transforming this challenge requires a strategic shift from fragmented aid to scalable, coordinated investment, focusing on proactive measures. Dr. Leonard Mizzi of the European Commission highlighted the EU's substantial commitment of €3.4 billion (Team Europe €6.5 billion) through 2027, part of a broader €30 billion global nutrition effort. However, he stressed the need to move beyond small-scale pilot projects to ""nutrition-sensitive investments at scale,"" advocating for ""big ticket"" financial instruments exceeding €100 million. This requires effectively aligning private sector investment, as current blending and guarantee instruments are often insufficient for large-scale, bankable projects. Crucially, donor coordination must improve to avoid the ""proliferation of initiatives"" that dilutes impact, alongside a renewed emphasis on country ownership, where partner nations prioritize value chains for both export and diverse diets, rather than presenting unmanageable ""shopping lists."" This proactive approach is echoed by Laborde, who urged intervention *before* crises escalate, utilizing early warning systems, remote sensing, and AI to reduce intervention costs by up to tenfold. This convergence of humanitarian and development funding, strategically deployed, can break cycles of recurring crises.

Crucial to this paradigm shift is harnessing private sector innovation and deploying evidence-based health interventions at scale. Adeline Lescanne of Groupe Nutriset underscored the private sector's vital role in local economic development, generating purchasing power and tax revenue, thereby strengthening national capacity to combat malnutrition. Her critical insight focused not on de-risking corporate finance, but on the end-user's inability to *afford* nutritious food, urging innovation in subsidizing the ""plus nutrition"" in products. William Moore of the Eleanor Crook Foundation reinforced this, stating that the most cost-effective interventions against malnutrition are often health-focused, rather than purely food-centric. He highlighted ""miracle products"" like Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), which costs mere cents per packet and can save over 90% of severely malnourished children, preventing the million annual child deaths from wasting. Moore's compelling argument is that if the global community chooses to, it can virtually eliminate child deaths from severe wasting by treating it as a global health crisis, demanding multi-year, development-oriented financing rather than sporadic humanitarian aid. Philanthropy, he contended, must increasingly focus its resources on scaling these highest-impact, evidence-based solutions, collaborating with governments to maximize leverage and achieve demonstrable results.

The pathway to effectively combating global malnutrition, therefore, hinges on decisive leadership and the integration of multi-sectoral strategies. This demands innovative, long-term financing that skillfully bridges the humanitarian-development divide, along with a concerted global effort to scale proven, evidence-based solutions. Despite the current crisis and shrinking traditional aid, opportunities abound to rethink and reposition resources. It is imperative that all stakeholders, from governments and international organizations to the private sector and philanthropic bodies, commit to strategic coordination, data-driven decision-making, and impactful partnerships, transforming current challenges into a definitive moment for global food security."
"Data, Storytelling, and Leadership: Tools for Women's Empowerment",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy-Enhr7Xhw,4 days ago,33 views,"## Bridging the Data-Narrative Divide: Empowering Women Through Integrated Tools for Systemic Change

The Paris Peace Forum convened a crucial session on ""Data, Storytelling, and Leadership: Tools for Women's Empowerment,"" immediately foregrounding the urgent need to bridge the persistent gap between lived experiences of gender inequality and actionable policy. The central tension underscored throughout the discussion was the challenge of transforming often invisible and underreported realities into compelling evidence that compels both grassroots communities and governmental bodies to drive sustainable, inclusive change. This panel illuminated how an integrated approach, leveraging technological innovation, personal narratives, and strategic leadership, is fundamental not merely to acknowledging women's struggles, but to actively fostering their empowerment and dismantling systemic barriers.

A primary revelation from the discussion was the critical role of data in rendering the invisible visible, particularly concerning gender-based violence (GBV). Elsa Marie D'Silva, founder of Red Dot Foundation, highlighted the pervasive ""data gap"" stemming from underreporting of sexual and gender-based violence, driven largely by women's lack of trust in formal reporting mechanisms. Her Safe City platform addresses this by enabling anonymous, geo-tagged reporting, transforming isolated incidents into visible ""hotspots"" that local communities can use for targeted advocacy with police and city officials. Complementing this, Dr. Hala El Sadeq outlined Egypt's ministerial efforts to formalize non-traditional crowd-sourced data, integrating it into national planning aligned with Egypt 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This involved establishing a Personal Data Protection Law, an Open Data Policy encouraging transparency and innovation, and developing digital public infrastructure that aggregates insights from projects like Qudwa Tech, all aimed at fostering an evidence-based approach to women's empowerment.

Beyond raw data, the power of storytelling emerged as a transformative force, humanizing statistics and fostering collective action. Khadija Amahal presented the Moroccan ""Get Heard"" project, which empowers young women to break the ""culture of silence"" surrounding GBV by equipping them with knowledge of protective laws and tools for digital storytelling via podcasts. This initiative not only provides a platform for healing and validation (""you're not alone"") but also ensures participant safety through options like anonymity and voice alteration, recognizing the cultural sensitivities and digital risks involved. The moderator underscored that narrative makes abstract statistics resonate as human experiences, building empathy that drives engagement. This shared experience cultivates solidarity, enabling women to collectively advocate for fundamental human rights, moving from individual withdrawal to collective empowerment.

Ultimately, effective leadership and robust capacity building are the levers that translate data and stories into impactful policy and systemic shifts. Ms. Lork Kheng, a Cambodian parliamentarian, powerfully argued that while financial investment and policy mandates are crucial, ""they are only as strong as the people who implement them."" She championed capacity building as the ""most valuable"" investment, exemplified by Cambodia’s ""Girl to Leader"" campaign and ""Mock Parliament"" initiatives that demystify leadership for young women. Dr. Hala El Sadeq further detailed how Egypt overcomes challenges like cultural resistance and digital divides in rural areas through innovative solutions like portable hardware labs and the ""info ladies"" model, where educated community members become trainers, fostering trust and transferring essential digital and entrepreneurial skills. These efforts, spanning from inter-ministerial coordination to direct community engagement, highlight a holistic, ecosystem-based approach to not just providing access, but ensuring genuine inclusion and opportunity, including economic avenues like e-commerce.

The strategic implication emanating from this discussion is clear: the path to genuine women's empowerment and the eradication of gender-based violence lies in a multi-pronged strategy that synergistically employs data to illuminate, storytelling to humanize, and leadership to implement. Investing in digital literacy, creating safe digital and physical spaces, and fostering community-led advocacy are not just social imperatives but economic accelerators, promising significant societal dividends. The continued, collaborative investment in these integrated tools, involving all segments of society, is essential to dismantle deeply entrenched social norms and unlock women's full potential, ensuring a future where every woman's voice is heard, valued, and acted upon."
Holding the Line for Democracy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egFpFvMogDg,4 days ago,127 views,"## Beyond Abstract Peace: Youth, Women, and Accountability in a Disrupted World

The Paris Peace Forum's panel on ""Holding the Line for Democracy"" revealed a profound tension between aspirational calls for global cooperation and the stark, immediate demands for accountability and tangible action in a world grappling with multifaceted crises. While Hillary Clinton's opening remarks posited a shared belief in a ""more peaceful, cooperative, and prosperous future,"" emphasizing the need for ""new coalitions for peace, people, and the planet"" through reinvented multilateral diplomacy, the subsequent discussion by a cohort of young leaders quickly pivoted from broad pronouncements to urgent, lived realities. The moderator, Trisha Shetty, set the stage by highlighting unprecedented biodiversity loss and the panel's commitment to addressing ""what's not working,"" signaling a deliberate move beyond celebratory ""talk shops"" towards concrete solutions.

This imperative was underscored with searing clarity by Dr. Mayada Adil from Sudan, who eloquently challenged the very notion of ""peace"" as an abstract concept, especially from the perspective of the Global South. Having previously leveraged fashion as a political instrument to champion democratic change in Sudan in 2019, Adil’s impassioned plea exposed the hypocrisy of international accolades while her country now endures genocide in Darfur, with thousands dead and widespread sexual violence. She declared that peace, whether in Sudan, Ukraine, Gaza, or Congo, ""cannot be an abstract concept"" and ""must come with accountability,"" lest it merely ""reward impunity"" for perpetrators. Echoing this intertwining of societal and environmental ethics, Gabriela Hearst, a creative fashion director, articulated her belief that ""fashion is political, political is fashion,"" drawing a direct correlation between the historical subjugation of nature and the oppression of women. Her business model, centered on ""just paying attention"" to ethical sourcing and empowering women in the supply chain, exemplifies how conscious economic activity can become a political act, noting the direct link between women's economic independence and community upliftment.

The discussion further articulated a forward-looking vision, with Chiara Nirghin advocating for a redefinition of history not as memorization of the past, but as ""prototyping the future"" through technology. She identified the current era as an unparalleled opportunity for young people, particularly young women, to ""build"" and ""lead this space"" in the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence, provided that the underlying data is ""accountable, transparent, and has integrity."" Supporting this call for youth empowerment and inclusive leadership, Michael Gallieno, UNICEF Ambassador for Education, asserted that peace cannot be built without young people, pushing for their inclusion as ""present and future generation[s]"" in diplomatic processes. He proposed that if he were a Minister of Foreign Affairs, he would prioritize panels featuring both young people and leaders to address issues from peace and nature to sustainable development, alongside a significant increase in women's representation in diplomacy, reinforcing Clinton's call for reinvention with specific emphasis on inclusion.

The strategic implication emanating from this panel is unambiguous: effective responses to global crises necessitate a radical shift from superficial dialogue to profound, accountable engagement, particularly with the voices of youth and women from the Global South. The panel’s collective message transcends the usual diplomatic discourse, demanding that abstract commitments to peace and progress be grounded in concrete action, justice, and the empowerment of those most directly impacted. For policymakers and experts, this means moving beyond conventional frameworks to actively champion inclusive institutional reforms, hold perpetrators of violence accountable, and genuinely integrate the innovative, often overlooked, solutions proposed by these front-line leaders. Anything less risks perpetuating a cycle of rhetorical commitment without substantive change, as the poignant reminder of those suffering beyond the forum's walls dictates."
30 Years after the Dayton-Paris Accords: What Aspirations for the Peace [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ayz-eFQTPK8,4 days ago,193 views,"## Dayton's Enduring Dilemma: Navigating Bosnia and Herzegovina's Future Between Historical Anchors and European Aspirations

Thirty years after the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement brought an end to the brutal war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), a critical discussion at the Paris Peace Forum revealed a nation grappling with a peace framework that, while foundational, now significantly impedes its state functionality and European integration. While the Accord cemented a fragile peace, it simultaneously entrenched a fragmented political structure that, combined with the strategic exploitation of historical trauma by political elites, stifles progress. The central tension lies between a deeply rooted past that continues to be weaponized for political gain and the palpable yearning among BiH's citizens, particularly its youth, for a future defined by genuine European integration, robust rule of law, and internal unity.

The panel underscored Dayton's paradoxical legacy: a necessary peace treaty that has inadvertently fostered institutional paralysis. Benjamin Haddad, French Minister Delegate for Europe, observed that the war in BiH highlighted how ""war has never left our continent,"" drawing a stark parallel to contemporary conflicts. While acknowledging the Agreement's role in cessation of hostilities, panelists articulated how its ethnically-based constitutional framework, riddled with loopholes, undermines effective governance. Ivana Korajlić, Executive Director of Transparency International in BiH, asserted that many politicians ""cling to the document as it is the most important, most sufficient document for the political system,"" mistakenly treating a peace framework as a definitive political blueprint, thus blocking essential reforms. Vladimir Underlag, a human rights activist, concurred, stating that while Dayton ""definitely good"" for ending bloodshed, it subsequently failed to foster strong institutions or a unified educational system, which is crucial for societal healing and national cohesion. This structural rigidity, as Ivana Vučević, a researcher and journalist, explained, is actively maintained by political actors who find it ""much easier to control resources, to control institutions if everything is specifically and concretely divided.""

The discourse further illuminated a profound disconnect between the lived reality of BiH's citizens and the political narratives that perpetuate division. Emina Pašanović, a Youth Delegate of BiH, passionately argued that her country is far ""so much more than just the recent tragic history,"" possessing over a millennium of continuous statehood. She highlighted that despite political rhetoric portraying ethnic and religious groups as incompatible, citizens ""cooperate on a daily level and… live perfectly well by ourselves."" This peaceful coexistence, however, is overshadowed by political elites who, rather than engaging in reconciliation based on facts, leverage the past for ""personal interests,"" thereby impeding the country's forward momentum. This political manipulation, often manifested as manufactured crises or secessionist threats, serves to divert public attention from pressing socio-economic issues and governance failures, thereby preventing the consolidation of Bosnian statehood.

A significant point of contention emerged regarding the role of international intervention, particularly the Office of the High Representative (OHR). While acknowledging the historical necessity of international oversight in the post-conflict period, panelists largely advocated for a shift towards increased domestic ownership. There was a consensus that the OHR's presence, despite its past utility in imposing critical laws for state-building, now inadvertently allows local politicians to shirk responsibility, making it ""easier for them not to agree"" by externalizing accountability. However, the discussion presented a nuanced perspective: while direct ""interventionism"" should be minimized, a guiding and partnership role from the European Union is essential. Commissioner Marta Koos affirmed that the EU's commitment to BiH’s integration is unwavering, particularly through initiatives like the €1 billion Growth Plan, which prioritizes critical reforms in education and infrastructure. She underscored the youth's determination ""not to become another lost generation,"" a sentiment she views as a powerful ""motivating mantra"" for progress towards a unified Europe.

The strategic implication of this ongoing stagnation is dire, fostering a ""brain drain"" of young, educated citizens and threatening the country's very viability. The call to action is clear: BiH urgently requires a fundamental shift towards pro-democratic, pro-European politics that prioritizes the rule of law and robust, accountable institutions. While the EU offers a crucial ""safe zone"" and the only credible path to a stable future, true progress necessitates internal reconciliation, systemic constitutional reform (potentially even a ""Dayton 2.0""), and a political class genuinely committed to serving all citizens, rather than perpetuating divisions for narrow self-interest."
The China Factor: Which Role and Impact in the New Coalitions?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYDPnDr4x2o,4 days ago,362 views,"## The Unfolding Multipolarity: Rebalancing Power, Reshaping Global Governance, and the Indispensable ""How"" of China's Rise

The Paris Peace Forum's panel on ""The China Factor"" critically examined the fundamental transformation gripping the international system, moving definitively beyond the post-Cold War unipolar order. Rather than merely confirming a shift towards multipolarity, the discussion immediately pivoted to understanding the profound implications of dispersed power and the inherent complexities of global governance in an era where established norms are under intense revision. The central tension animating the debate was not the existence of multiple centers of power, but rather the imperative to define and proactively shape this emergent landscape towards a cooperative and resilient global order.

Ángel Gurría, President of the Paris Peace Forum, underscored the ""most profound transformation"" since the Cold War, observing a decisive ""rebalancing"" of global power away from a US-dominated, Western-led alliance. He cited the rise of new actors like China, India, the EU, and regional blocs such as BRICS and MIKTA, whose growing influence is actively challenging traditional institutions like the UN and IMF. Gurría further illustrated this rebalancing through the declining share of the US dollar in global transactions, noting its shift from ""about 75-80%... to maybe 60 moving into 50%,"" highlighting a tangible diffusion of economic power. While acknowledging this dispersion as inherently ""good,"" he cautioned that it simultaneously creates significant complications for achieving consensus on pressing global challenges, ranging from climate change to public health, with international agreements often lacking ""operational clauses"" despite years of negotiation.

Expanding on this evolving global architecture, Maha Hosain Aziz argued that the conventional lenses of bipolarity or even multipolarity are now insufficient, proposing ""polycentricity"" as a more accurate framework. This paradigm emphasizes the increasing agency of a broader array of actors—including smaller states, tech leaders, civil society organizations, and CEOs—who are actively driving global change, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict, where non-state entities often filled leadership voids. Aziz highlighted instances like Elon Musk's provision of satellite internet to Ukraine or the UAE's emergence as an ""AI hub for the Global South,"" illustrating how technological prowess can translate into diplomatic influence, extending beyond the traditional great power rivalry. This polycentric dynamic, she contended, signifies a positive empowerment of diverse stakeholders, although it concurrently introduces new vectors of influence and potential dependencies.

Sergey Radchenko, offering a historian's perspective, framed the contemporary geopolitical landscape primarily as a ""strategic competition"" between China and the United States. While acknowledging key distinctions from the Cold War—such as increased global interconnectedness and a less overtly ideological Chinese threat—he underscored fundamental similarities in the comprehensive nature of this rivalry, spanning economic, technological, and military domains. Radchenko asserted that the mutually assured destruction inherent in direct conflict fuels a ""greater resort to proxy conflicts,"" echoing Cold War dynamics. From this realist vantage point, he argued that while ""win-win cooperation"" might be feasible on specific, limited issues like climate change or arms control (albeit currently off the table), the core strategic competition ultimately precludes fundamental win-win scenarios, as ""you cannot have two tigers live on one mountain."" His policy prescription, provocatively termed ""containment"" (though acknowledging ""milder forms"" akin to Cold War détente), suggested a need for a clear-eyed approach to managing this enduring rivalry.

The discussion then delved into China's evolving strategic posture and global responsibilities. Yuan Jiakai elaborated on China's consistent, self-focused approach, driven by significant domestic challenges like industrial overcapacity, insufficient consumption, and rapid demographic aging. He maintained that China has ""learned to be patient"" and prioritizes internal development, viewing external engagement through the lens of securing a ""favorable external environment."" However, Gurría pointed out that China's rise has inevitably transformed its economic endeavors into a ""broader strategic project"" encompassing geopolitical and technological dimensions, leading to the muscular exercise of its ""multipower."" He highlighted the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a prime example, where its extensive infrastructure investments in the developing world have resulted in substantial debt burdens for recipient nations—reaching ""150 billion... of debts to China""—sometimes leading to Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure, complicating perceptions of benign development assistance. Gurría emphasized that the world must ""welcome"" China's inevitable ascent, but the critical question shifts from ""if"" China will lead to ""how"" it will exert its power, demanding a responsible and transparent approach to global leadership.

Jiakai also introduced the emerging role of Chinese private enterprises in global governance, citing their increasing overseas revenue and their subsequent engagement in local communities, sometimes in partnership with international bodies like the OECD. This represents a distinct, less state-centric facet of China's global footprint, indicating a broadening approach to international influence. Conversely, Aziz highlighted a more concerning aspect of China's expanding influence through AI. She warned of potential ""AI aid dependencies,"" where China's leading role in providing digital Silk Road infrastructure could create single-vendor ecosystems, limiting the control of recipient nations and raising questions about digital sovereignty and new forms of reliance. This indicates that China's engagement, while diversifying beyond traditional state-led initiatives, also presents new challenges and power dynamics in the digital domain. Radchenko further analyzed the Sino-Russian relationship as primarily driven by a shared desire to curtail US global hegemony, rather than a deep ideological alignment. He noted their complementary economies and a pragmatic recognition of mutual benefit derived from avoiding a direct confrontation. However, he also underscored the inherent power imbalance and the differing approaches to governance export. He stressed that while these nations prioritize their own interests, their strategic convergence compels other nations to engage with them in a nuanced manner, with the ongoing Ukraine conflict serving as a stark litmus test for China's willingness to translate its growing power into active, responsible global leadership.

Ultimately, the panel revealed a global order in flux, characterized by a complex interplay of emerging powers, diffusing influence, and competing visions for the future. The prevailing strategic takeaway is that merely observing multipolarity is insufficient; a concerted effort is required to proactively shape this evolving landscape, demanding responsible engagement from all major actors, particularly China. The trajectory of global governance in the 21st century will depend less on *who* holds power, and more on *how* that power is exercised and whether it can steer the international system towards genuine cooperation rather than escalating fragmentation and zero-sum competition."
Security vs. Sustainability: The Hidden Costs of a Geopolitical Race for Minerals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-ZDlSDttII,4 days ago,132 views,"## Navigating the Critical Crossroads: Competition, Cooperation, and the Future of Mineral Diplomacy

The global agenda, increasingly dominated by the imperatives of climate action and digital transformation, is placing unprecedented strategic importance on critical minerals. At the Paris Peace Forum, a distinguished panel convened to dissect the escalating tension between competition and cooperation within this vital sector. What emerged was a nuanced, often paradoxical, landscape: a clear and urgent need for enhanced collaboration juxtaposed with a palpable resurgence of resource nationalism, fragmented value chains, and the complex interplay of economic ambition, environmental stewardship, and geopolitical rivalry. This session ultimately revealed that the path to resilient and sustainable mineral supply chains is fraught with challenges demanding innovative and equitable solutions beyond traditional paradigms.

The discussion opened with a stark assessment from Karim Dahou of the OECD, highlighting a fivefold increase in export restrictions across critical mineral sectors over the past decade. This trend, he posited, signifies a palpable rise in ""resource nationalism,"" a phenomenon not entirely new, citing China's restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan in the early 2010s. Such restrictions, affecting materials crucial for clean energy, digital industries, and defense, directly contribute to fragmented value chains, raising concerns about cost escalation and potential delays in achieving global net-zero objectives. While initiatives like the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) were conceived to foster cooperation between consumer and producer nations, progress has been notably slow, underscoring the formidable barriers to collective action in an increasingly competitive environment.

Amidst this backdrop, both established and emerging mineral-rich nations are charting ambitious courses to secure their positions in the global supply hierarchy. Ana Brnabić revealed Serbia's substantial lithium reserves, estimated to meet up to 90% of current EU demand, and emphasized a strategic partnership with the EU. This collaboration aims not merely at extraction, but at integrating Serbian lithium into European sustainability and competitiveness frameworks, crucially upholding the EU's stringent environmental and social standards. Yet, the Serbian experience illustrates the complex local dynamics, with protests against new lithium mining juxtaposed against the historical acceptance of far dirtier coal extraction, underscoring a perceived ""lack of public awareness"" and the challenge of balancing environmental concerns with the energy transition. Concurrently, Saudi Arabia, as articulated by Turki Al-Babtain, is undergoing a profound transformation. Under Vision 2030, the Kingdom aims to elevate its mining sector to the third pillar of its national economy, shifting from mere resource extraction to value creation and global resilience. This involves unlocking vast domestic mineral potential through a competitive investment climate and establishing ""Manara Minerals"" to invest internationally across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, securing critical inputs and promoting local value addition.

The panelists further elucidated the intertwined challenges of establishing local value chains and addressing the environmental footprint of mining. Both Brnabić and Al-Babtain underscored their nations' aspirations to process raw materials domestically, retaining added value and fostering industrialization. Brnabić specifically argued that domestic production could reduce Europe's dependence, provided entire supply chains are localized. Kadri Simson, however, offered a sobering perspective on the EU's autonomy efforts, including the Critical Raw Materials Act. While acknowledging targets for domestic extraction, processing, and recycling, she conceded that these measures alone would not achieve full autonomy, necessitates continuous ""follow-up actions."" She starkly stated that in the battery sector, ""dependency equals vulnerability,"" with the EU’s 90% reliance on a single supplier (China) being a critical lesson from Russia’s weaponization of gas supply. Simson championed recycling as a vital component, though recognizing its limitations, and stressed the importance of diversified partnerships, not just for supply security but also for promoting high environmental and social standards globally, ensuring that ""mutually beneficial partnerships"" are the bedrock of future supply. The discussion repeatedly highlighted that technology and innovation, ranging from advanced battery chemistries (like LFP or solid-state) to sustainable mining practices, are critical not only for cost-effectiveness but also for reducing environmental impact and fostering long-term resilience, thereby avoiding scenarios where producer nations remain trapped in single-commodity economies vulnerable to market fluctuations.

In summation, the dialogue at the Paris Peace Forum revealed that securing critical mineral supply chains is less about simplistic competition or cooperation and more about navigating a multifaceted global transition. The strategic imperative is to forge diverse, transparent, and equitable partnerships that prioritize shared value creation, advanced technological integration, and stringent environmental and social governance. The geopolitical and economic risks of fragmentation are too high, making a concerted global effort—one that balances national aspirations with collective sustainability goals—the only viable pathway to a resilient and prosperous future for all.

Supporting Civil Society Under Pressure: How Charity Lotteries can Help Reshape the Funding [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nVyE7KsMfk,4 days ago,21 views,"## Civil Society's Funding Paradox: Can Charity Lotteries Bridge the Gap Between Rising Need and Dwindling State Support?

As Europe's civil society organisations (CSOs) are called upon to perform increasingly essential functions—from upholding democratic norms to delivering critical social services—they face a crippling paradox: their resources are becoming more precarious, politicised, and unpredictable. A panel discussion at the Paris Peace Forum revealed that the advocacy for charity lotteries is not merely a call for a new revenue stream, but a strategic push for a fundamental reshaping of the sector's funding architecture. The core tension that emerged was the urgent need to decouple civil society's survival from the volatility of state budgets and the restrictive mandates of traditional donors, positioning citizen-funded lotteries as a source of resilient, independent capital.

The discussion was framed by a stark diagnosis of a sector under extreme pressure, which one speaker termed not just a funding issue but a ""crisis of values."" The keynote provocation came from the simultaneous trends of increasing demand on CSOs and the systematic withdrawal of reliable public financing. According to Civil Society Europe, 44% of European CSOs have recently faced unexpected funding cuts from national governments, undermining their ability to plan and operate sustainably. This instability is felt acutely in France, where it was suggested that one in four associations could disappear by 2026, an existential threat to the nation's social fabric. The financial landscape is further distorted by a clear bias, with funds more readily available for direct service delivery than for politically sensitive work on human rights, advocacy, and the rule of law, effectively neutering the watchdog function of civil society. The sudden withdrawal of major funders like USAID and the Open Society Foundations has intensified this precarity, creating a hyper-competitive environment for the remaining, often restricted, grants.

The central proposal advanced by the panel was the establishment of legal frameworks across Europe to permit and encourage charity lotteries, transforming them from a niche mechanism into a systemic funding pillar. This model is presented as a structural solution, offering what traditional funding increasingly does not: unrestricted, long-term, and predictable income. Described as the ""oxygen"" for CSOs, such funding is critical for covering core operational costs, retaining expert staff, and fostering innovation—luxuries that project-based grants rarely afford. Joel Weiller of Médecins du Monde highlighted that this type of capital enables organisations to undertake ""improbable"" pilot projects that institutional donors, bound by rigid metrics and political caution, would not risk supporting. The thriving charity lottery market in the United Kingdom, which raises over a billion pounds annually, was cited as a powerful proof-of-concept, demonstrating a model that provides sustainable, subscription-based revenue that is accessible to smaller, grassroots organisations, not just established giants.

A primary fault line exposed by the debate lies between the incumbent model of state-directed or traditional institutional funding and the proposed citizen-driven lottery model. The former is increasingly seen as a vector of political influence and bureaucratic burden, forcing CSOs to align with donor agendas rather than community needs. The lottery model, by contrast, diversifies this dependency, drawing on broad public participation. An implicit point of contention, directly addressed by the UK's Lotteries Council, is the fear that charity lotteries would cannibalise revenue from state-run lotteries or traditional donations. Evidence from the UK market suggests this is unfounded; the two are complementary, appealing to different motivations—one of light-hearted entertainment linked to altruism, the other of more direct philanthropic giving. The discussion therefore reframed the debate not as a zero-sum competition for funds, but as an expansion of the overall philanthropic ecosystem.

An unexpected analytical link was drawn between lottery participation and long-term philanthropic behaviour. Data from the UK indicates that lottery players are significantly more likely to leave legacy gifts in their wills, suggesting that this form of engagement cultivates a deeper and more lasting commitment to charitable causes than a simple one-off donation. Another striking observation was the depiction of the current funding environment as a brutal contest where the closure of major funding sources has left CSOs fighting over scraps, forcing funders to become risk-averse and favour established grantees. The primary blind spot in the discussion, however, was the political and regulatory battle required to implement this model in countries with entrenched state monopolies, like France. While the benefits were clearly articulated, the significant political capital needed to overcome vested interests and rewrite national gambling laws remains a formidable, and largely unaddressed, obstacle.

Ultimately, this discussion positions the expansion of charity lotteries as a critical hedge against the growing instrumentalisation and unreliability of state and institutional funding. The strategic implication is clear: empowering citizens to directly fund a diverse civil society through this regulated mechanism offers a pathway to a more resilient, innovative, and politically independent third sector. It is less a simple fundraising tactic than a structural reform to strengthen the democratic immune system across Europe."
The Case for Putting Children First,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVRZo8VICMA,4 days ago,17 views,"## The Unacceptable Regression: Why Investing in Children is a Strategic Imperative, Not a Charitable Act

The Paris Peace Forum recently convened a critical discussion on ""The Case for Putting Children First,"" a panel that transcended conventional discourse to frame child well-being not merely as a humanitarian concern, but as a fundamental pillar of global stability, economic growth, and national security. Amidst converging global crises and a disconcerting reversal in progress, the overarching thesis that emerged was clear: concerted, strategic investment in children is the ""magic bullet"" to unlock sustainable development and avert catastrophic future scenarios, demanding a holistic, nationally-led, and innovatively financed approach.

Sierra Leone stands as a compelling testament to the transformative power of intentional investment in human capital. Minister Chernor Bah underscored his nation's journey from grappling with one of the world's highest maternal mortality rates to achieving a two-thirds reduction, alongside dedicating an unparalleled 22% of its national budget to education, providing daily school meals to a million children. This was not a luxury but a deliberate, strategic choice made amidst pervasive challenges like poverty, climate vulnerability, and disease outbreaks. Minister Bah articulated that such ""concerted investment in human capital"" is the singular pathway to effectively address immediate crises and secure long-term prosperity, emphasizing the critical need for robust political leadership, predictable partnerships that align with national visions, and a flexible, innovative approach to implementation, viewing countries like Sierra Leone as ""labs"" for scalable solutions.

Extending this perspective, Nesmy Manigat of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) passionately argued for education as a systemic game-changer, not merely a pursuit for its own sake. He posed a stark question: can societies thrive when children are either out of school or in schools where they learn nothing? Manigat underscored that GPE's mission extends beyond mere school enrollment to fundamentally transforming education systems, ensuring children acquire relevant skills for their future. Citing the alarming statistic that half of those involved in gang violence are children, he warned that failure to invest in their cognitive, personal, and emotional development at an early age – particularly from 0-10 years – creates a fertile ground for societal breakdown, making the ""cost of inaction"" profoundly expensive.

However, Valerie Nkamgang Bemo of the Gates Foundation introduced a sobering note of urgency, revealing a critical paradigm shift: for the first time in two centuries, the global curve for child mortality reduction is reversing. Despite the existence of known solutions for preventable diseases and malnutrition, this regression highlights a collective failure. Bemo challenged the common rhetoric of children being the ""future,"" questioning the logic of reduced funding amid escalating global crises. She reiterated that child well-being is inherently holistic, interlinked with healthy mothers, robust families, thriving communities, and ultimately, a resilient economy, urging for increased domestic and international funding to halt this unacceptable trend.

Bertrand Bainvel of UNICEF and Jean-Sebastien Conty of the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs further elaborated on the ""perfect storm"" confronting children—marked by rising conflicts, climate change, displacements, and deepening inequalities—exacerbated by diminishing resources. Bainvel advocated for an evolved narrative that links child rights directly to national interests, showcasing the ""amazing return on investment"" in child well-being (e.g., halving child mortality in 25 years). Conty highlighted France's commitment, citing the nation’s significant financial contributions and its role in fostering crucial multilateral dialogues, driven by the sheer scale of child suffering and the compelling evidence of high returns on investment in areas like nutrition and vaccination. Both stressed that political will alone is insufficient; practical tools, sustained funding, and innovative financial mechanisms, including blended finance and private sector engagement, are indispensable.

Addressing the systemic challenges inherent in mobilizing such investment, the panel converged on several critical pathways for driving change. Minister Bah emphasized the imperative of ""bringing the public along,"" countering skepticism towards international aid by demonstrating tangible local impact and working transparently with local populations. A key focus emerged on empowering the most marginalized, especially girls, as a non-emotional, data-driven strategy for exponential returns across all development indicators. Manigat and Bemo highlighted the importance of shifting from a ""charity"" mindset to recognizing parents' inherent desire to invest in their children, fostering domestic resource mobilization and addressing the debt burden that often constrains low-income countries. Ultimately, the consensus underscored that true progress necessitates strengthening national capacities and leadership, transitioning from fragmented, externally-driven projects to country-led, scalable initiatives that meaningfully involve young people not just as beneficiaries, but as co-designers and drivers of their own future.

The discussion served as a stark reminder that in this moment of perceived ""crisis in global development,"" failure to decisively invest in children would be a profound strategic miscalculation. The collective future hinges on recognizing child well-being as a top-tier geopolitical imperative, demanding sustained, holistic, and innovative financial commitments driven by robust national ownership and inclusive partnerships to deliver on the promises made for 2030 and beyond."
Leveraging AI Innovations for Development: From Action to Impact,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pmdubo6qe8,4 days ago,114 views,"## Navigating the AI Crossroads: Local Agency, Global Foundations, and Equitable Progress

The recent panel discussion at the Paris Peace Forum, focusing on AI innovation and development, underscored a critical tension: the imperative for indigenous technological agency in the Global South versus the undeniable need for foundational global infrastructure and ethical governance. What emerged was a complex interplay of localized aspiration and universal challenges, revealing that the equitable future of AI hinges on transcending a zero-sum mentality to foster collaborative, context-aware development. The debate illuminated not just disparate regional experiences, but a collective challenge in ensuring AI benefits all, without exacerbating existing inequalities or creating new forms of digital dependency.

At the heart of the discussion was a forceful call for African nations to reclaim their narrative in AI development. Kate Kallot, CEO of Amini AI, passionately articulated that AI must be ""built for us and by us,"" emphasizing the necessity for solutions tailored to local contexts and driven by indigenous problem-solving. Citing M-Pesa's mobile banking system in Kenya, developed long before Western counterparts like Apple Pay, Kallot highlighted Africa's historical capacity for ""leapfrogging"" innovation under conditions of scarcity. This approach, she argued, demands ""agency"" and ""sovereignty"" over technology and data, ensuring that AI addresses problems *we* deem important and aligns with *our* cultures, languages, and ways of life, rather than being mere consumers of external, pre-packaged solutions. The current trajectory of global AI, where a few dominant players control technology, risks replicating past colonial dependencies, a paradigm Kallot stressed must be actively avoided.

However, the vision of localized AI leapfrogging is inextricably linked to formidable infrastructural and human capital challenges. Tomas Lamanauskas, Deputy Head of the ITU, acknowledged the validity of local solutions but stressed the non-negotiable requirement for ""foundational building blocks."" He presented stark statistics: while two-thirds of the global population is connected, only about one-third of low-income countries, particularly in Africa, have meaningful access. The disparity extends to advanced infrastructure like 5G and data centers, with Africa, despite holding 20% of the global population, accounting for less than 2% of global data centers and under 1% of data center capacity. This digital divide, coupled with a significant ""value chain"" gap – where 50% of data may originate from Africa, but only 5% of its value is captured locally – underscores the urgent need for investment in infrastructure, skills, and policies. The ITU, through initiatives like the Digital Infrastructure Investment Catalyst and AI Skills Coalition, aims to mobilize public and private investment to bridge these gaps, highlighting the multi-trillion dollar investment required to achieve meaningful connectivity and capability.

The conversation further broadened to encompass the critical role of ethical governance and policy, particularly through UNESCO's groundbreaking work. Gabriela Ramos, former Assistant Director General at UNESCO, pointed out that AI development is not only accelerating exponentially but remains highly unequal, with 60% of technologies developed in the US and 20% in China. Despite this, she offered ""good news"": the cost for developing AI *applications* (as opposed to foundational models) has plummeted by 90% due to open-source solutions, democratizing access to AI tools. UNESCO's efforts have shifted the AI conversation from a purely technical focus (e.g., algorithm bias) to a human-rights-based ethical framework, embedding principles of human dignity, sustainability, inclusivity, accountability, transparency, and the rule of law into AI development. Ramos introduced a ""Four I's"" framework for countries to achieve AI readiness: Incentives, Infrastructure, Institutions, and ensuring that *these issues* are truly in *our* hands. The stark reality is that 55% of countries lack AI policies and 85% lack regulations, indicating a profound global governance deficit that must be addressed alongside technological advancement.

From an industry perspective, Chris Sharrock, Vice President at Microsoft, affirmed the panel's consensus on AI's potential and challenges, emphasizing the corporate responsibility for ""diffusion"" of AI technology for responsible use. He highlighted that half the world still lacks meaningful access to the digital economy due to deficits in electricity, broadband, compute, skills, and devices. Sharrock underscored the urgency, noting that if advanced nations accrue exponential productivity gains from AI while others lag, global inequalities will widen alarmingly. Microsoft's strategy involves ""humility"" and ""partnership,"" working with international organizations like the ITU on programs like ""Elevate"" (aiming to train 20 million people in AI skills) and ""Partners to Connect"" (committing to connect 250 million people worldwide). He stressed that the goal is not to impose a single model but to enable countries to build their own solutions, while also advocating for access to high-performance compute and cloud infrastructure to ensure that no region is relegated to a ""second-best solution"" in the rapidly advancing AI landscape.

In conclusion, the debate crystallized that the future of AI is not a foregone conclusion, but a collaborative construction site. It demands a balanced approach that respects and empowers local agency and context-specific innovation, particularly in the Global South, while simultaneously committing to global partnerships for building essential foundational infrastructure, skills, and inclusive governance frameworks. The strategic imperative is to move beyond a competitive, isolationist ""sovereignty"" towards a shared ""resilience"" that leverages collective ingenuity and resources to ensure AI serves human dignity and equitable development, preventing the digital divide from becoming an unbridgeable chasm.

The State of Development Finance in 2025: What Ways Forward?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14tVIdB9dOc,4 days ago,99 views,"## Development Finance at a Crossroads: Between a Fading ODA Consensus and the Unmet Trillion-Dollar Challenge

Convened at the Paris Peace Forum, this discussion on development finance transcended a simple accounting of funding gaps to reveal a system in profound crisis. Faced with unprecedented needs for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the panel exposed a dual fracture: not merely a shortfall of trillions, but a foundational crisis of legitimacy, governance, and relevance in the post-war financial architecture. The conversation crystallized the urgent search for a new paradigm, moving from a donor-recipient model to a more complex ecosystem of co-investment and shared sovereignty.

### **The Tripartite Challenge: A System Under Unprecedented Strain**
The initial provocations established a stark diagnosis of the current predicament, framing it as a tripartite challenge. The first element is a political crisis of multilateralism itself, where the very forums for cooperation are questioned. Compounding this is a rapidly widening financing gap between the escalating needs of the Global South and the diminishing public resources of traditional donors, a gap starkly quantified by OECD projections of a potential 17-20% drop in Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2025 following a 9% decline in the previous year. The third and most critical challenge is the consequent questioning of the existing ODA model's structures and representativity, pointing to a system ill-suited to the scale and nature of 21st-century problems.

### **Blueprints for a New Architecture: From Measurement to Mobilization**
In response to this systemic strain, a portfolio of new ideas and structural proposals emerged, signaling a definitive shift from merely optimizing the old aid system to architecting a new one. The conceptual starting point is a change in measurement, embodied by the Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD) framework, which aims to provide a more holistic picture by capturing all resource flows, including private finance and South-South cooperation. Beyond metrics, concrete proposals sought to reinvent financial mechanisms, notably through four levers for Africa: transforming public-private partnerships to build entire economic systems, activating domestic capital markets, repurposing multilateral development banks (MDBs) as powerful investment attractors, and embedding digital and green technologies into financial flows. This vision was complemented by calls to more efficiently allocate scarce ODA to the most vulnerable states while simultaneously unlocking untapped domestic capital, particularly household savings, to fuel private sector investment. The MDBs themselves articulated a reform agenda centered on working as a coherent system, enhancing their capital adequacy, and deploying de-risking instruments to crowd in the private sector.

### **Governance and Legitimacy: The Central Fault Line**
The most significant fault line exposed during the discussion was not financial but political, centered on governance and legitimacy. The ""elephant in the room"" was identified as the profound governance deficit within the international financial institutions, where borrowing countries lack a meaningful voice and representation in strategic decision-making. This critique reframes the debate from one of simple resource transfer to a crisis of solidarity and a demand for genuine co-creation of solutions. The tension was palpable between a Northern-centric focus on technical reforms to make the existing system more efficient and a Southern-led call for a fundamental redistribution of power. This schism underscores a deeper debate about the very purpose of development finance: is it an instrument of donor policy or a shared tool for global stability and prosperity? The legitimacy of any new framework, it was argued, will depend entirely on the inclusivity of its governance.

### **The Urgency of Data and the Blind Spot of Politics**
While high-level reforms dominated the discourse, the discussion was punctuated by an unexpected sense of quantifiable urgency, particularly the OECD's alarming projections of ODA contraction, which threaten to disproportionately impact Least Developed Countries and Sub-Saharan Africa. This data-driven reality check underscored the immediate consequences of systemic inertia. Yet, the session also revealed a significant blind spot: a tendency to underplay the deep-seated political economy barriers that inhibit the mobilization of private capital in the most fragile contexts. While ""de-risking"" was presented as a key solution, there was limited engagement with the granular challenges of political instability, weak regulatory environments, and the lack of bankable projects that deter private investment. The conversation remained largely at the level of financial engineering, without fully confronting the political engineering required to make markets work for development in the world's toughest environments.

The strategic implication of this debate is unequivocal: technical and financial innovations, while necessary, are insufficient to address the scale of the global development challenge. The core task is fundamentally political—it requires rebuilding trust and overhauling the governance of the international financial architecture to give the Global South co-ownership of the system. Without this political reset, the ambition of mobilizing trillions for a sustainable and equitable future will fail to translate into reality."
Harnessing AI to Protect Peace and Foster Social Resilience,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aANs1niPc24,4 days ago,19 views,"## The Algorithmic Peacebuilder: High-Tech Tools Confront Ground-Level Realities

At the Paris Peace Forum, a panel of practitioners convened to explore the potential of artificial intelligence not as a threat, but as a proactive instrument for peace and social resilience. The discussion moved swiftly beyond familiar dystopian warnings to showcase a series of nascent, real-world experiments in algorithmic intervention. Yet, this forward-looking survey ultimately revealed a profound tension: while AI offers an unprecedented ability to scale dialogue and deliver data-driven insights in conflict zones, its application is fundamentally constrained by deep-seated issues of digital inequality, data sovereignty, and the persistent risk of embedding historical biases in future-shaping technologies.

### **From Provocation to Pilot: A New Framework for AI in Conflict**

The foundational premise of the discussion was a deliberate pivot from the challenges of AI—such as biased data sets, monopolistic corporate control, and the North-South digital divide—to its promise. The moderator, Brett Solomon of Berkeley's Human Rights Center, framed the current moment as an experimental phase of ""pilot projects,"" presenting a critical window for civil society and policymakers to actively shape the technology's application. This framing established that the keynotes were not theoretical propositions but reports from the field. Panelists presented initiatives that use AI to synthesize consensus among polarized populations, provide critical services to marginalized groups, model the outcomes of policy decisions, and offer non-judgmental support to trauma survivors. The shared undercurrent was the use of technology to achieve a scale and depth of engagement that would be impossible through conventional, analog means.

### **Algorithmic Interventions: A Survey of New Proposals**

The specific projects detailed by the panelists illustrated a range of strategic applications. Natali Lewin Schwartz of the Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) outlined the use of the Remesh AI platform to conduct large-scale, structured online dialogues between Israelis and Palestinians. This approach seeks to circumvent physical and political barriers, using AI to rapidly identify and surface points of consensus from thousands of polarized inputs, thereby creating a data-backed mandate of public opinion for diplomatic processes. In a different context, Juliet MacDowell of Mission AI presented a specialized translation app for migrants and asylum seekers. Its innovation lies not just in translation but in a built-in ""escalation model"" that uses AI to detect keywords related to trauma or crisis, automatically flagging the need for a human interpreter. This model explicitly acknowledges the limits of automation in high-stakes communication, building a human safeguard into the algorithmic workflow. Tackling systemic issues, Michael Bąk of AI Safety Asia argued for developing regional ""knowledge ecosystems"" in Southeast Asia. This initiative directly confronts data colonialism by proposing AI models trained on local data, languages, and cultural contexts to make policy outcome predictions more accurate and less biased than those derived from Global North-centric systems. Similarly, Leonora Tima of Gender Rights in Tech (GRIT) detailed the co-creation of AI chatbots with communities to support survivors of gender-based violence, providing a confidential and non-stigmatizing first point of contact where social barriers might otherwise prevent individuals from seeking help.

### **The Emerging Fault Lines: Data Sovereignty, Scale, and Safety**

Beneath the consensus on AI's potential, significant operational and ethical fault lines emerged. A primary tension exists between the pursuit of universal, scalable platforms and the imperative for hyper-localized, culturally attuned tools. While projects like ALLMEP's demonstrate AI's power to operate at a massive scale, the work of GRIT and AI Safety Asia underscores that effectiveness and ethical integrity often depend on bespoke models built from the ground up with specific communities. This debate is inextricably linked to the question of data sovereignty and the risk of perpetuating colonial dynamics, where data from the Global South is extracted to train systems whose architecture and profits remain in the North. Furthermore, the discussion highlighted a crucial trade-off between efficiency and safety. The need for human oversight, as demonstrated in Mission AI’s escalation model, acts as a necessary brake on purely automated systems, particularly when engaging with vulnerable individuals whose words and experiences can be easily misinterpreted by algorithms lacking nuanced, trauma-informed context.

### **The Unconnected and the Unsaid: Acknowledging the Blinds Spots**

The panel's most telling moments came from its acknowledgment of inherent limitations. Audience questions regarding the application of these technologies in environments with little to no internet connectivity, such as parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, exposed a significant blind spot. The conversation had largely presumed a digitally connected world, focusing on software and data while overlooking the foundational hardware and infrastructure without which these solutions are irrelevant. This disconnect reveals a critical gap between high-level technological ambition and the material realities of many conflict-affected regions. Another powerful, if sobering, insight was the candid discussion of ethical compromises. Leonora Tima openly questioned whether truly ethical data collection from vulnerable populations is even possible, given the inherent power imbalances. This frankness shifted the conversation from a purely technical exercise to a deeply moral one, emphasizing that the most significant challenges are not algorithmic, but human.

### **The Strategic Takeaway**

The discussion made clear that integrating AI into peacebuilding is less a technological hurdle than it is a profound political and ethical challenge. For policymakers and diplomats, the strategic imperative is not merely to fund innovative AI projects, but to invest deliberately in the frameworks of digital sovereignty, community co-creation, and rigorous human-centric safeguards that ensure these powerful tools serve to reduce global inequities rather than amplify them."
Bridging the Energy Gap: Spreading the Current through Collective Action,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jEGORnF4UA,4 days ago,33 views,"## Bridging the Energy Divide: A Multi-Stakeholder Approach to Accelerating Africa's Green Transition

The persistent paradox of Africa's immense renewable energy potential set against widespread energy poverty underscores a critical global challenge demanding urgent, concerted action. This expert discussion at the Paris Peace Forum illuminated not only the scale of this divide but also a compelling blueprint for its resolution, advocating for a transformative paradigm shift that prioritizes inclusive partnerships, innovative finance, and human-centric development over conventional, siloed approaches. The central thesis that emerged is a collective recognition that achieving universal, clean energy access in Africa is an integral component of global stability and prosperity, requiring a grand coalition of diverse actors to de-risk investment and cultivate local capacity.

### **Defining the Collective Ambition and Transformative Goals**

The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), introduced as a driving force, articulates a bold vision: a world where everyone enjoys access to affordable, reliable, clean energy, with the means to leverage it for improved livelihoods. Launched with a threefold ambition—connecting 1 billion people, averting 4 billion tons of carbon emissions, and creating/improving 150 million jobs—GEAPP’s strategy fundamentally reframes energy access. It transcends mere electrification, asserting that ""changing energy changes lives"" by empowering communities, powering essential services, and acting as a primary engine for economic growth and human dignity. This holistic perspective challenges traditional development models by directly linking energy solutions to broader socio-economic upliftment, from powering schools and hospitals to supporting farmers and small businesses.

### **Innovating Partnerships and Catalytic Finance**

A key insight from Ghana's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Samuel, alongside GEAPP’s CEO, Agnese, is that progress is not achieved in isolation. The imperative is for ""new coalitions,"" a deliberate convergence of governments, the private sector, development banks, and philanthropies. Ghana's own success story, boasting 89% energy access through a diversified mix of hydro, gas, and renewables, exemplifies this multi-partner approach, collaborating with entities like GEAPP, the Solar Alliance, the African Development Bank, and various bilateral partners. Agnese further elaborated on GEAPP's innovative financial model, which aims for a 15x catalytic effect—meaning every dollar invested by philanthropy or public funds attracts an additional $15 from other sources. This de-risking and leverage strategy is crucial for unlocking the massive capital required, demonstrating a pragmatic pathway to scaling up investment by aligning diverse financial instruments and political will.

### **Confronting Structural Hurdles and Local Realities**

Despite the ambitious vision, the discussion squarely faced the formidable structural hurdles. With 600 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lacking electricity, and billions more suffering from unreliable supply, the challenge is acute. The Democratic Republic of Congo, despite possessing an unparalleled 100 GW hydroelectric potential, paradoxically maintains an average electrification rate of just 21%, with rural areas significantly lower. This highlights a critical need for policy reforms and innovative, context-specific solutions. Ghana’s proactive establishment of a Renewable Energy Authority and its exploration of pioneering hybrid solar-on-dam systems, designed to boost capacity without extensive land acquisition, exemplify adaptable strategies. Such innovations are crucial for circumventing the limitations of traditional grid expansion and for reaching remote populations, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to energy infrastructure.

### **The Human Element: Skills, Just Transition, and Trust**

The most poignant and often overlooked dimension of the energy transition, as highlighted by Laurence Tubiana, is the human element. The necessity of a ""just transition"" means ensuring that decarbonization actively benefits citizens, creating new jobs (80% of new energy sector jobs are in renewables) and providing pathways for workers currently in fossil fuel industries. This necessitates a significant investment in local skills, including electricians and technicians, who are the ""first brick"" for on-the-ground implementation. Schneider Electric's Gilles emphasized the role of companies in ""training the teachers"" to disseminate new energy solutions effectively. Furthermore, the discussion exposed a critical financial inequity: African nations face inflated risk premiums on international loans, often due to perceived risks. The call to re-evaluate this, and to classify green investments as development capital rather than burdensome debt, is a plea for greater trust and solidarity, recognizing that investing in Africa's green future is an investment in global stability.

### **The Strategic Takeaway**

Achieving universal, clean energy access in Africa transcends a mere infrastructure project; it is a profound, multifaceted challenge demanding integrated strategies, sustained political will, innovative financial models, and a deep-seated investment in human capital and local ownership. The collective voice from this discussion underscores that a truly transformative path forward requires a holistic, human-centric approach that embraces new coalitions, leverages catalytic finance, and rigorously addresses the skills gap, ultimately fostering economic growth and human dignity across the continent."
What does AI Owe Children? iRAISE Proactive Approach for Beneficial AI for Children,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PATIcrLP_J0,4 days ago,53 views,"## Navigating the Uncharted: AI, Childhood, and the Urgent Imperative for Responsible Design

The advent of artificial intelligence presents an unparalleled inflection point for the trajectory of childhood, demanding a profound re-evaluation of our collective responsibilities. This panel, convened under the urgent question ""What does AI owe children?"", immediately pierced the superficial discourse, revealing a complex landscape where technological momentum, ethical obligations, and developmental realities collide. Far from a simple debate on pros and cons, the discussion underscored a critical tension: the unparalleled potential of AI to enhance learning and well-being versus its inherent capacity to reshape the very foundations of human development in ways we are only beginning to comprehend. The overarching thesis that emerged is a stark call to action: only through deliberate, cross-sectoral alignment, guided by robust ethical frameworks and the direct voice of children themselves, can humanity steer AI towards a future that truly benefits its youngest citizens.

### Framing the Future: Urgent Realities and Foundational Rights

The opening provocations immediately anchored the discussion in the immediate and pervasive reality of AI's presence in children's lives. Two-thirds of UK teenagers and nearly 40% of Argentine children aged 9-11 are engaging with AI technologies on an almost daily basis, often with unknown long-term impacts. This widespread, yet largely unmonitored, interaction necessitates a universally accepted framework for ethical development. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by all but one state globally, was presented as this indispensable legal and ethical compass. Its core principles—protection from harm, provision for development (education, health), and active participation—must translate directly into tangible requirements for AI systems. This shift, from merely mitigating risks to actively designing for benefit, mandates a proactive approach to technology stewardship, rather than a reactive one.

### Catalyzing Innovation: New Paradigms for Beneficial Design

Amidst the cautionary notes, the panel articulated several forward-looking proposals aimed at harnessing AI's transformative potential for children. OpenAI's commitment to prioritizing safety above all else, exemplified by co-designed parental controls, proactive notification systems for distressing content, and the transparent development of age-prediction tools, illustrates a pivotal move towards embedding ethical considerations at the earliest stages of product development. Beyond mere protection, there is a clear imperative to quantify and amplify the intrinsic value AI can offer, particularly in educational and creative domains. The Joan Ganz Cooney Center's advocacy for ""child-inspired design"" and ""participatory research methods"" represents a methodological innovation, transforming children from passive users into active co-creators. This approach not only yields unique insights—such as a more nuanced understanding of age-appropriate design beyond simplistic banding—but also ensures that AI systems are developed to genuinely enhance children's unique capacities for learning and imagination, rather than diminish them through automation. Furthermore, the emphasis on last-mile translational science and product incubators aims to bridge the critical gap between academic research and practical industry implementation, accelerating the integration of child-centric design principles into actual products.

### Navigating the Abyss: Debates, Fault Lines, and Unprecedented Challenges

The discussion sharply illuminated several profound fault lines and unprecedented challenges inherent in AI's rapid ascent. A central tension lies in the breakneck speed of AI's development and adoption, which far outpaces the capacity for comprehensive research into its long-term effects. This ""speed mismatch"" creates an ""evidence gap"" that demands rapid, informed decision-making based on the best available data, even when incomplete. Distinct from prior media innovations, AI's **generative capacity** blurs the lines between human and machine, fostering one-on-one **emotional bonds** without the mediating influence of adults. This poses unique risks to children's cognitive development, self-perception, and emotional resilience. The potential for AI to replace critical thinking and analysis, leading to what some panelists termed ""AI anxiety"" among young people regarding future work prospects, represents a significant societal concern. Furthermore, the debate highlighted the complex interplay between anthropomorphic design choices in AI and the potential for emotional over-reliance, particularly among adolescents whose brains are hardwired for social connection. These discussions revealed a critical need to understand what constitutes ""optimal"" versus ""unacceptable"" levels of human-like interaction and to deploy ""red flags"" to clearly demarcate AI-driven experiences.

### The Unforeseen and the Overlooked: Nuance and Hidden Concerns

Beyond the immediate challenges, the panel unveiled several unexpected insights and areas requiring greater attention. The global nature of AI adoption necessitates a truly **global lens** for policy and design, transcending US or European-centric perspectives to address the diverse developmental needs and vulnerabilities of children worldwide, including those lacking basic connectivity. A surprising revelation was that children, at times, exhibit a more acute awareness of AI's potential risks (e.g., its impact on thought processes) than adults, yet paradoxically, they can also be more susceptible to its deceptive aspects (e.g., misinterpreting AI as a trustworthy confidante for confidential information). This underscores the complex, sometimes contradictory, ways in which children perceive and interact with AI. The concept of ""constructive friction"" in learning was also highlighted as a potential blind spot; while AI can provide seamless solutions, true learning often stems from challenge and independent thought. The imperative is to design AI that fosters, rather than bypasses, this essential element of cognitive growth. Finally, the realization that an emotional over-reliance on AI might be inadvertently encouraged by design elements, such as highly anthropomorphic language and persistent availability, suggests that seemingly innocuous design choices carry significant developmental implications.

### A Unified Front: The Strategic Imperative for a Child-Centric AI Future

The strategic takeaway from this discourse is unequivocal: the future of AI and childhood is not a predetermined outcome but a collective design project. To ensure AI serves as a beneficial force for the next generation, a multi-stakeholder alliance is not merely desirable but existentially necessary. Governments, industry leaders, research institutions, civil society organizations, and critically, children themselves, must converge their expertise, resources, and perspectives. This collaboration must prioritize the systematic generation of evidence, bridge the research-to-practice gap, and establish robust, globally aligned ethical frameworks rooted in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Only by fostering an environment of shared responsibility, transparency, and continuous learning can we effectively navigate AI's complex terrain, shaping a future where technology amplifies, rather than diminishes, the inherent potential and well-being of every child."
Natural Resource Governance & Conflict Transformation: From Extraction to Cooperation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qHF_sWUrPE,4 days ago,71 views,"## Governing the Ground Beneath Our Feet: Transforming Conflict Through Equitable Resource Management

The global landscape is increasingly defined by intense competition for natural resources, exacerbated by geopolitical shifts and the escalating demands of climate change. Against this backdrop, regions abundant in critical minerals often find themselves entangled in protracted conflicts, where the very wealth that could drive development instead fuels instability. This panel delved into the complex interplay between resource governance and conflict transformation, revealing a consensus that truly sustainable peace in these vulnerable contexts hinges upon a paradigm shift towards equitable, transparent, and inclusively managed resource systems.

**Unbalanced Gains and Entrenched Power Structures Fueling Instability**

The core contention articulated across the panel was that the skewed distribution of benefits and persistently unequal access to natural resources remain primary drivers of conflict, particularly in mineral-rich nations. Renée Larivière of Interpeace underscored that nearly a quarter of the global population, residing in conflict zones, reaps only marginal returns from extractive industries. These regions, often characterized by a fragile state presence or weak governance, face heightened risks due to competition over resources, illicit mineral trading by non-state actors, widespread community displacement, and severe environmental degradation. Christof Kurz from International Alert, focusing on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), painted a stark picture where local communities are systematically disadvantaged, with power structures disproportionately benefiting traders, international markets, financiers, and politically connected elites, further weakening governance and political will. Rosine Atafeinam Abalo of Women in Mining in Africa highlighted an often-overlooked yet critical gender dimension, citing the tragic incident of 42 women and one man dying in an artisanal mine collapse, emblematic of how cultural barriers, power dynamics, and a lack of formalization actively exclude women from equitable participation and safety, despite their significant presence in the sector.

**Innovative Frameworks for Inclusive Resource Governance and Peace**

Against these daunting challenges, the panel put forward several innovative approaches designed to reorient resource management towards peacebuilding. Renée Larivière advocated for a ""peace-responsive approach"" that explicitly integrates the private sector, development banks, and investors into conflict-affected areas, equipping them with tools to bridge economic and social disparities and to approach risk with a peacebuilding lens. Christof Kurz emphasized the efficacy of local, multi-stakeholder committees comprising civil society, the private sector, and local government to enforce laws, resolve issues pragmatically, and enhance accountability. His project's research revealed rampant opacity in tax collection within artisanal mining, where numerous fees lacked legal basis, underscoring the urgent need for basic transparency and oversight. Rosine Atafeinam Abalo proposed empowering women through specialized cooperative structures within both artisanal and large-scale mining, complemented by targeted training, advocacy for dedicated funding (e.g., 30% for women-led projects), and debunking cultural myths that exclude women from mining. Raïssa Sifa Kasongo, representing Action for Development and Entrepreneurship in the DRC's Ituri province, highlighted the transformative potential of agroforestry and restoration projects, not merely for environmental benefit but for fostering social cohesion, constructive dialogue, and youth employment—critical for diverting young people from armed groups and rebuilding fractured communities.

**Navigating the Fault Lines: State Fragility and Stakeholder Engagement**

Significant fault lines emerged around the persistent issue of state capacity and political will. Kurz pointed out the DRC's lack of a detailed national strategy for its artisanal mining sector, leaving a crucial segment of the economy without a clear path for development or formalization. Kasongo underscored the profound challenge posed by the state’s limited authority in many regions, where armed groups often act as de facto lawmakers, rendering official statutes meaningless. This creates a critical dilemma: how to engage with existing power brokers, including influential religious leaders and even armed groups, to effect change when formal state structures are weak or absent. The panelists also grappled with the private sector’s inherent limitations in conflict mitigation and governance, necessitating specific frameworks to ensure their engagement contributes positively to peace rather than exacerbating tensions. Furthermore, the disproportionate impact on women in resource-rich areas highlights a systemic failure to integrate gender perspectives meaningfully into governance and economic planning.

**The Foundational Overlooked: Basic Infrastructure and State Authority**

Beyond the immediate challenges, the discussion illuminated critical, often overlooked, dimensions. Kurz emphasized that in many remote, rural mining areas, the most pressing need isn't high-tech solutions but basic infrastructure—electricity, reliable communication networks—without which even sophisticated transparency tools remain unusable. This underscores a fundamental disconnect between external interventions and ground-level realities. Kasongo starkly articulated the paradox of a resource-rich nation suffering from ""disease"" and destruction, where the very institutions meant to uplift its people are either corrupt or absent, leading to widespread poverty amidst mineral wealth. This structural failure of the state to re-establish authority and enforce laws is a pervasive blind spot, often obscured by narratives that solely blame the resources themselves. Atafeinam Abalo's powerful anecdote of high female mortality in mines due to unsafe practices, combined with cultural barriers preventing their formal inclusion, revealed the deep-seated societal issues that continue to marginalize a significant portion of the workforce.

**The Imperative for Comprehensive, Inclusive Governance**

This panel unequivocally concluded that the path to transforming conflict in resource-rich regions lies in a holistic, multi-faceted approach to governance. It is not enough to simply extract wealth; the strategic imperative is to ensure that natural resource benefits are shared equitably, managed transparently, and that all stakeholders, particularly local communities, women, and youth, are empowered to participate meaningfully. Governments, companies, and civil society must collectively rebuild foundational state authority, enforce the rule of law, and invest in both human and physical infrastructure at the local level. By doing so, they can shift the narrative from resources as a curse to resources as a catalyst for genuine peace and sustainable development."
Addressing the Debt Crisis and Global Sustainable Economic Recovery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guqkz9J_cUA,4 days ago,86 views,"## The Silent Erosion: Rethinking Debt Sustainability Beyond Traditional Metrics for Climate Action and Development

The escalating crisis of sovereign debt, particularly in low-income nations, presents a profound dilemma: the imperative to service accumulating liabilities against the urgent need for substantial, long-term investment in climate resilience, adaptation, mitigation, and poverty alleviation. This panel, convened at the Paris Peace Forum, illuminated not merely the financial strain gripping vulnerable economies but a pervasive, silent erosion of developmental capacity, underscoring that current approaches are inadequate to bridge the widening gap between debt obligations and global sustainability goals. The discourse revealed a critical tension between immediate fiscal stability and the foundational investments required for a sustainable future, demanding a re-evaluation of both financial instruments and international cooperation paradigms.

### The Amplifying Crisis and Unmet Funding Realities

The debt crisis is amplifying, presenting dual challenges of solvency for some nations and liquidity for others, as highlighted by Friederike Röder. The existing debt stock poses an immediate burden, but the underlying vulnerability to unforeseen shocks, exemplified by Jamaica's climate-induced distress, underscores the need for proactive mechanisms beyond simple crisis response. Stéphane Cherby further problematized this, characterizing the situation as a ""silent crisis,"" where a significant portion of national resources (e.g., Egypt's 33%) is diverted to debt servicing, effectively stifling essential, long-term development. The staggering financial need for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action, estimated at 3-4 trillion USD annually, starkly contrasts with the mere 25-50 billion USD currently mobilized through blended finance, revealing a critical, largely unaddressed funding chasm.

### Innovative Instruments for Fiscal Flexibility and Development Impact

In response to these systemic challenges, several innovative mechanisms were proposed and demonstrated. Friederike Röder advocated for the widespread adoption of ""debt clauses"" that permit the suspension of debt payments during natural disasters, offering crucial immediate liquidity. She also championed ""global solidarity levies,"" suggesting a tax on highly globalized, often polluting sectors like first-class or private jet travel, with proceeds dedicated to financing global climate resilience. A compelling case study from Côte d'Ivoire, presented by Lansiné Diaby, showcased a multi-faceted approach: aggressive domestic tax mobilization post-pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, combined with leveraging a World Bank AAA partial credit guarantee (240M EUR) to secure 400M EUR in cheaper, longer-term financing. The resulting 60M EUR savings were not merely absorbed into the general budget but were explicitly re-invested into an existing World Bank education project, funding 30 new schools, thereby creating a tangible ""debt swap for development"" with direct social impact. William Roos further elaborated on the vital role of multilateral development banks (MDBs), beyond direct lending, in providing technical assistance for debt management, strengthening governance, and utilizing credit enhancements to de-risk investments for private capital, thereby fostering the development of local capital markets through innovative financial products.

### Inter-Actor Disconnect and Risk Perception Mismatch

A central fault line within the global financial architecture was exposed by Stéphane Cherby: the profound disconnect among MDBs, private investors, and regulators. He argued that these three critical actors often operate with conflicting understandings and decision-making frameworks, leading to counterproductive outcomes. A key example is the treatment of MDB guarantees by prudential regulators, which frequently assign them a capital cost equivalent to direct loans, thus negating their intended catalytic effect. Furthermore, a shared critique emerged regarding rating agencies' often-skewed perception of sovereign risk in emerging markets. Despite empirical data, such as that from the Global Emerging Markets (GEM) database, indicating remarkably low actual default rates (0.5-1%) for projects involving MDBs, high-risk premiums persist. This perception-reality gap inflates financing costs, making affordable debt inaccessible and underscoring the ""silent crisis"" where robust, long-term development is undermined by misinformed risk assessments.

### The Overlooked Structural Impediments and Catalytic Potential

The enduring ""silent crisis"" of slow-burning debt accumulation, which drains national resources without the dramatic urgency of acute financial collapses, constitutes a significant blind spot in global policy. Its long-term developmental implications are often underestimated. Conversely, the successful, simplified onshore ""debt swap for development"" in Côte d'Ivoire provides an unexpected counter-narrative, demonstrating that practical, high-impact financial innovations are achievable without undue complexity. This case challenges prevailing assumptions about the inherent difficulties of implementing such instruments. Moreover, the panel illuminated the often-underestimated catalytic potential of MDBs to bridge the chasm between perceived and actual risk. Through strategic guarantees and active engagement in market development, MDBs can actively reshape the investment landscape, inject liquidity into local markets, and de-risk crucial projects for private investors, fostering a more conducive environment for sustainable development finance.

The strategic takeaway from this discourse is clear: addressing the global sovereign debt crisis transcends mere financial adjustments. It demands a fundamentally integrated, cooperative, and innovative approach that recognizes the deep interdependence of fiscal health, climate action, and social development. By fostering unprecedented collaboration among MDBs, private capital, and regulators, recalibrating risk assessments to reflect ground realities, and channeling liberated fiscal space directly into targeted development projects, the international community can move beyond crisis management to proactively construct a resilient and equitable global economy capable of meeting the profound challenges of the 21st century."
What Does Successful Holistic Child Wellbeing Look Like?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_qgGVH6t6A,4 days ago,33 views,"## Recalibrating Global Development: Investing in Children as a Strategic Imperative

The Paris Peace Forum's roundtable on ""What Does Successful Holistic Child Wellbeing Look Like?"" convened experts, diplomats, and policymakers to dissect the multifaceted nature of child development in an increasingly complex global landscape. The central tension of the debate revolved around balancing comprehensive, aspirational goals for child wellbeing with the pragmatic need for focused, evidence-based, and cost-effective interventions in a constrained global funding environment. While there was broad consensus on the intrinsic and strategic importance of investing in children, significant discussions emerged regarding the optimal scope, precise measurement, and effective implementation strategies to achieve tangible, sustained impact.

### Setting the Foundational Stakes

The discussion initiated with the introduction of the Child Priority Framework (CPF), presented by Zohreen Badruddin from the Paris Peace Forum, as a unifying investment strategy aimed at centralizing children within the international development agenda. This push for re-prioritization is particularly urgent given the current global context, marked by decreasing Official Development Assistance (ODA) and a palpable shift towards risk-averse funding, which disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable populations. Beatrix Nere's stark reminder that global child mortality is projected to rise this year—a reversal of two decades of progress—provided a critical backdrop, emphasizing the severe consequences of inaction. Concrete data further underscored the high stakes: Shawn Baker of Helen Keller Intl. highlighted that 45% of infant mortality is attributable to malnutrition, underscoring the critical ""first 1000 days"" window for intervention. Margarita Focu's-Licht from the Global Partnership for Education reinforced the multiplier effect of early investment, noting that education alone contributes to 50% of global economic growth and is a powerful driver of poverty reduction.

### Defining the Scope: Comprehensive Pillars vs. Targeted Focus

The CPF delineates five core pillars for child wellbeing: child and maternal health, education and learning, nutrition and food security, physical protection, and psychosocial wellbeing. While these pillars received general endorsement, the discussion quickly revealed a significant fault line concerning the framework's optimal age scope. Shawn Baker, Hannah Stephenson (Save the Children), Mike Wishart (World Vision International), Anton Lavia Garcia (Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation), and Bertrand Badiuvel (UNICEF) strongly advocated for expanding the focus beyond the initial 0-8 year age range to explicitly include adolescents. They argued that excluding this critical demographic risks perpetuating intergenerational cycles of vulnerability, education dropout, violence, and neglects adolescents' potential as agents of change. Furthermore, there was a collective call, notably from Bertrand Badiuvel, to integrate additional cross-cutting areas such as Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and to specifically address child poverty, recognizing its multi-dimensional character beyond simple deprivation.

### Methodology and Implementation: Evidence, Integration, and Ownership

The operationalization of the CPF emerged as a key discussion point, with a focus on robust methodologies and effective implementation strategies. Zohreen Badruddin emphasized the imperative for ""key indicators"" that are not only measurable but also robust, comparable across diverse geographies, and capable of driving action. Shawn Baker proposed a shift in focus from measuring *outcomes* to measuring *access* to nutrition services and foods, arguing this would yield more immediate and actionable insights. A pervasive theme was the necessity of an *integrated* approach across the defined pillars, rather than continuing with siloed interventions, a point underscored by Mike Wishart and Gulnara Mukhamadieva (Aga Khan Foundation), who observed that national governments often lack the resources for separate sectoral efforts. Margarita Focu's-Licht and Jean-Sébastien Conty (French MFA) highlighted the importance of national ownership and local stakeholder engagement, with Mukhamadieva stressing the vital role of community-led interventions and robust ""care infrastructure"" for long-term sustainability. The discussion also ventured into practical applications, such as ""child-focused budgeting"" (Mukhamadieva) and embedding climate resilience into interventions (Badiuvel). Sourav Rimal (Karmayogi Foundation) provided a compelling example from Nepal, demonstrating how investment in ""play"" infrastructure significantly boosted school attendance, illustrating the power of innovative, grassroots solutions born from a holistic perspective.

### Nuances and Emerging Fault Lines: Rights, Aspirations, and Funding Realities

Several speakers introduced critical nuances that could shape the framework's future. Anton Lavia Garcia strongly advocated for a ""rights-based approach,"" asserting that children should be viewed as subjects of rights, not merely passive recipients of aid. He cautioned against inadvertently creating a standalone ""child sector"" that might isolate child-focused efforts, suggesting instead a ""child lens"" be applied across all development sectors, including humanitarian contexts. Hannah Stephenson and Xavier Hospital (Mérieux Foundation) issued a cautionary note against adopting a ""minimum floor"" mentality, arguing that such an approach risks undermining the broader aspirations for children. They urged for a framework that aims for ""reaching for the stars,"" particularly in areas like mental health, and protection against all forms of violence, including psychological, sexual, and bullying. The backdrop of declining global ODA, as highlighted by Jean-Sébastien Conty, underscored the urgent need for strategic prioritization, identifying initiatives with the highest value-added, and leveraging domestic financing, with France's upcoming G7 presidency identified as a potential platform to champion these discussions.

### The Strategic Takeaway

The consensus of the roundtable robustly affirmed that investing in children is not merely a moral imperative but a strategic, indispensable necessity for cultivating inclusive, resilient, and prosperous societies. The strategic implication of this discussion is clear: future efforts must embrace a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach that judiciously transcends rigid age silos and the global-local divide, all anchored within a comprehensive, rights-based framework. Ultimate success will profoundly depend on effectively mobilizing a diverse coalition of stakeholders around actionable, evidence-based metrics, while critically adapting implementation strategies to a dynamic and resource-constrained funding landscape that demands both unwavering ambition and judicious efficiency."
From Safety to Security: Governing Adversarial Use of AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NprpLHuiYA,4 days ago,320 views,"## The Perilous Race: Navigating AI's Adversarial Frontiers and the Crisis of Collective Governance

The burgeoning discourse on Artificial Intelligence has undergone a critical reorientation, shifting from a predominant focus on ""AI safety""—addressing unintended systemic consequences—to the more immediate and alarming concerns of ""AI security."" This panel, convened at the Paris Peace Forum, illuminated the profound implications of AI’s malicious exploitation by hostile actors, spanning cyber warfare, sophisticated disinformation campaigns, and the unsettling prospect of its application in weapons of mass destruction. What emerged was a stark revelation: humanity stands at a precipice, where technological prowess, driven by an unchecked commercial and geopolitical race, threatens to outstrip our collective capacity for ethical governance and strategic foresight.

**The Accelerating Threat Landscape and Foundational Concerns**

Yoshua Bengio, spearheading the first international report on AI risks following the Bletchley Park summit, laid bare a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Beyond mere deepfakes and fraud, AI is increasingly enabling the manipulation of public opinion through unprecedented scales of persuasive, even individualized, content generation. In cybersecurity, AI significantly lowers the barrier to entry for malicious actors, while its potential to aid in the development of biological and chemical weapons, previously theoretical, is now confirmed by recent studies. This technological ascent is not merely about capability; it's fundamentally reshaping power dynamics. Bengio warned of an ""excessive concentration of power"" in the hands of a select few corporations and states, challenging existing frameworks of governance, democracy, and economic equilibrium. Nicolas Butts of Microsoft corroborated these cyber threats, citing a five-fold increase in AI-driven information operations by nation-state actors, leading to digital cloning and targeted propaganda. He highlighted the chilling efficiency of AI in enhancing spear-phishing and ransomware attacks, noting a 4.5x surge in effectiveness for the latter. Crucially, Butts pointed out that the current lack of widespread AI-powered sophisticated malware is not due to technological limitation but rather the continued success of basic cybercriminal tactics, underscoring fundamental vulnerabilities in prevailing cybersecurity postures.

**Governance Deficits: Beyond Crisis to Proactive Consensus**

Jacinda Ardern’s impassioned intervention, rooted in the tragic Christchurch attack, powerfully illustrated the critical lapse in pre-emptive governance. The live-streamed terrorist act underscored that existing protections were woefully inadequate against the malevolent amplification provided by digital platforms. The subsequent Christchurch Call to Action, a multi-stakeholder initiative, demonstrated that retrofitting guardrails post-crisis is an arduous undertaking. However, this initiative, supported by tech companies, governments, and civil society, has successfully developed crisis response protocols and algorithmic transparency tools to mitigate violent content—a testament to what collective will can achieve. Ardern's core challenge resonated deeply: how can we forge consensus on AI guardrails *without* the catalyst of catastrophe? She observed that governments often succumb to commercial pressures, fearing that stringent regulation might impede domestic innovation in the global race for market dominance. This hesitation, she argued, actively undermines a proactive approach to safety. Robin Geiss of UNIDIR further amplified concerns about the impending era of ""machine warfare,"" where autonomous weapon systems, fueled by AI, accelerate the pace of conflict, marginalizing human decision-making and ethical oversight. He exposed a dangerous ""speed bump"" dilemma: nations are reluctant to self-restrain, fearing that rivals will forge ahead, creating a ""go all in"" mindset that defies even fundamental international humanitarian law. Geiss also brought to light the insidious creep of AI into nuclear decision-making and its potential to democratize the development of biological and chemical weapons, accessible even to those lacking specialized expertise.

**The Socio-Technical Imperative and a Vision for a Shared Future**

Vilas Dhar asserted that the ""monsters under the bed"" of AI are not purely technical but profoundly socio-technical. The focus must shift from merely identifying technological flaws (data bias, algorithmic errors) to constructing robust social institutions that ensure responsible development and deployment. He challenged the ""AI arms race"" narrative, describing it as a dangerous and ill-defined political slogan often used to justify massive, unscrutinized investments, detached from human dignity and collective welfare. Dhar advocated for a ""new multilateralism"" that prioritizes building resilient institutions, fostering accountability, and democratizing decision-making processes beyond the confines of dominant tech players and nation-states. He pointed to the OECD AI Incident Monitor and the nascent UN International Scientific Panel as crucial steps towards this vision. This framework moves beyond the false dichotomy of ""innovation versus regulation,"" proposing instead a proactive investment in AI that is human-aligned and serves the public good, rather than being solely market-driven. The Global South, currently relegated to the role of recipient, must be empowered as an equal partner in shaping this future, not merely as a market for diffusion or a testing ground for technologies without adequate safeguards.

**The Strategic Takeaway:**

The imperative for robust AI governance transcends technical fixes; it demands a profound re-evaluation of global power dynamics and a collective commitment to human-centric principles. The current competitive ""race for tech dominance"" dangerously incentivizes recklessness, creating a governance vacuum that risks escalating AI’s adversarial uses. Moving forward requires a ""coalition for humanity"" that actively engages governments, industry, civil society, and crucially, the Global South, to collaboratively develop proactive guardrails and equitable decision-making frameworks. By redefining AI development as a shared journey toward collective benefit, rooted in trust and ethical principles, the international community can move beyond reactive crisis management to shape a future where AI serves to enhance human dignity and security, rather than imperiling it.

Civil Society as Pillar of Multilateral Process: A Broader and Deeper Approach [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-m2j5_jT6k,4 days ago,79 views,"## Navigating the Post-Catastrophe Landscape: The Imperative for a Transformed Diplomacy in Israel-Palestine

The Paris Peace Forum panel, convened amidst the fragile aftermath of recent conflict, illuminated a profound tension at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis: the urgent necessity for immediate, life-saving intervention runs concurrently with the critical, yet often elusive, imperative to forge a sustainable political horizon. Experts, diplomats, and civil society leaders underscored that merely managing the conflict, or reverting to outdated diplomatic paradigms, will only perpetuate a cycle of violence, demanding instead a truly ""broader and deeper"" engagement that fundamentally reinvents the approach to peace.

### From Fragile Ceasefire to Definitive End Goal

The initial provocations from the panel swiftly dismantled any illusions of a genuine ""ceasefire,"" with Aziz Abu Sarah starkly highlighting ongoing fatalities, particularly among children, and the continued absence of a full cessation of hostilities. This reality immediately reframed the debate, shifting the primary focus from merely halting violence to demanding an *enforceable* cessation, distinguishing it sharply from a temporary lull in ""conflict management."" The consensus converged on the urgent need for a clear, long-term end goal beyond the mere absence of violence: the termination of occupation, the guarantee of self-determination for Palestinians, and the establishment of an equitable, sustainable peace agreement for both peoples. Yael Berda further emphasized the dual challenge of simultaneously articulating a legitimate, sustainable vision and implementing immediate, necessary measures, especially given the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 85% of infrastructure is destroyed and winter looms.

### Cultivating New Ideas for a Shared Future

Addressing the diplomatic stagnation of prior decades, the panel articulated several innovative proposals to bridge the chasm between immediate crisis and long-term resolution. Romaric Roignan, representing the French Foreign Ministry, lauded the ""New York Declaration"" as a critical breakthrough, commending its innovative approach of intrinsically linking immediate necessities—a comprehensive ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and unimpeded humanitarian aid—with medium-term transitional governance for Gaza and the overarching vision of a two-state solution featuring a demilitarized Palestine integrated regionally. Nivine Sandouka championed a ""recognition plus"" framework, advocating for international recognition of a Palestinian state to be coupled with a concrete, actionable peace process plan that details economic prosperity and guaranteed security for both Israelis and Palestinians. Expanding on this, Yael Berda's ""A Land for All"" initiative proposed a confederation model, featuring two states operating within a framework of shared institutions for vital areas such as environment, public health, and economic measures, arguing that the groundwork for such cooperation can, and should, begin immediately. Crucially, the need for a UN-mandated international stabilization force was posited by Roignan to secure the ceasefire and support reformed Palestinian security forces, underpinning a transition towards full Palestinian ownership of governance arrangements. Across these proposals, the recurring emphasis was on leveraging civil society as an incubator for policy ideas and a vital conduit for trauma healing and reconciliation.

### Bridging Divides: Navigating Fault Lines and Fostering Dialogue

Despite the overarching call for a renewed approach, several critical fault lines and debates emerged. The very definition and current reality of the ""ceasefire"" remained contentious, with some viewing its announcement as a significant breakthrough, while others pointed to ongoing violence that rendered the term hollow. A persistent challenge articulated by multiple speakers was the disconnect between immediate humanitarian demands and the long-term political vision; the need to implement aid not merely as a temporary fix but as a building block for future self-governance and dignity. Berda critically assessed the ""stale two-state solution,"" asserting that traditional models of separation and segregation had ""failed miserably"" on October 7th, necessitating a reimagining of how two states can coexist through genuine integration rather than isolation. Additionally, the imperative for internal Palestinian reconciliation—unifying governance across Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem—was highlighted by Sandouka as a fundamental prerequisite for any credible peace process. The panel implicitly debated the pace of change, balancing the urgency of the present crisis with the methodical, often slow, work required for systemic transformation.

### Unforeseen Opportunities and Lingering Blind Spots

The discussion unveiled several unexpected insights and persistent blind spots. Strikingly, recent polling data, cited by the moderator and Yael Berda, indicated that 72% of Israeli voters would accept a regional deal including a Palestinian state, a figure far exceeding the support articulated by any mainstream Israeli political leader. This glaring disconnect between public sentiment and political discourse highlights a profound opportunity for civil society to de-risk these ideas and galvanize political will. Romaric Roignan spoke of the ""cognitive bubbles"" in which both Israeli and Palestinian societies largely exist, where the ""other"" is often invisibilized or dehumanized—a critical barrier to genuine peace that necessitates dedicated efforts to bridge. The deeply intertwined nature of Israeli and Palestinian lives, a lived reality of integration despite political fragmentation, was underscored by Berda, yet remains largely unacknowledged in official narratives. The failures preceding October 7th, perceived as a failure of diplomacy itself, unexpectedly presented a ""reset"" opportunity for new thinking. The ability of civil society, exemplified by Allmep and Interact's successful lobbying of the Pope and the G7 to integrate civil society into formal diplomatic processes, demonstrated an untapped wellspring of political imagination and influence.

### The Strategic Imperative: Leadership from the Ground Up

The strategic takeaway from this panel is unequivocal: a sustainable peace in Israel-Palestine demands an integrated, multi-layered approach that transcends traditional diplomatic confines. Political leadership, long absent or ineffectual, must emerge, but it will be powerfully catalyzed and guided by the robust engagement of civil society. The immediate imperative for an enforceable ceasefire and comprehensive humanitarian aid must be intrinsically linked to a long-term vision of equitable self-determination and regional integration. Crucially, addressing the deep-seated trauma on both sides, fostering internal Palestinian reconciliation, and empowering marginalized voices like women and youth are not ancillary tasks but foundational pillars upon which any genuine and lasting peace must be built. The current moment, despite its dystopian realities, offers a unique, albeit perilous, window for transformed diplomacy, driven by political imagination and accountability, to finally redeem both peoples.

Solution pathways to scale sustainable agriculture in Africa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yTTEmj-kP0,4 days ago,52 views,"## Recalibrating the Plough: Charting a Sustainable and Equitable Future for African Agriculture

African agriculture stands at a critical juncture, poised between a persistent cycle of low productivity, environmental degradation, and food insecurity, and an immense, largely untapped potential to address global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The recent Paris Peace Forum roundtable, focusing on sustainable agriculture and its financing in Africa, unequivocally highlighted that achieving this potential demands a holistic, African-led transformation. The core tension revealed was navigating the urgency of scaling investment and innovation while ensuring these solutions are genuinely adaptive, equitable, and resilient, especially against the backdrop of global geopolitical and climate crises, underscored by the pivotal year 2025.

### Confronting a Vicious Cycle: The Imperative for Change

The foundational challenge articulated by the discussion is Africa’s entrapment in a “vicious cycle” of poverty and land degradation. Leonardo (OCP Africa) starkly illustrated how the continent's predominantly tropical soils, among the oldest and poorest globally, drive a cascade of food insecurity, projecting a staggering $110 billion in food imports by 2030. This scenario compels farmers into practices that further deplete already fragile land, with over 500 million hectares already degraded. Augustin Granjorge (Paris Peace Forum) underscored the paradox: African agri-food systems could resolve up to 60% of SDG gaps, yet they attract less than 5% of global agricultural investments. This chronic underfunding exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, making the need for a paradigm shift in both approach and financing acutely urgent.

### Pillars of Progress: New Ideas for Transformation

A consensus emerged on a multi-pronged approach to break this cycle. Leonardo presented the ""4R Nutrient Stewardship"" (Right time, source, place, rate) as a scientifically proven method to boost yields, sequester carbon both above and below ground, and improve soil health, using phosphorus as a critical limiting nutrient example. Ismahane Elouafi (CGIAR) championed ""cost-effective, African-led innovation,"" emphasizing digital technologies and advanced genetics, including the development of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) for resilience, alongside improved staple crops. The ATLAS initiative itself, introduced by Augustin, proposes a robust framework for advocacy, consensus building, and transparent investment tracking to double agricultural investments by 2030. Furthermore, Younes (MAVA platform) and Frank (Nestlé) highlighted the efficacy of directly incentivizing farmers through conditional cash payments linked to sustainable practices, showcasing its potential for scaled adoption and positive impact on livelihoods.

### Bridging Divides: Navigating Definitions and Financing Complexities

The path forward is not without its intricate debates. A significant fault line emerged around defining ""sustainable agriculture"" for Africa. Ismahane argued for genuinely Africa-centric metrics, cautioning against externally imposed frameworks. Conversely, David Laborde (FAO) stressed the universality of scientific principles, advocating for global standards to avoid fragmentation and confusion, which deter investors. There was broad agreement on the need to simplify the current proliferation of performance indicators—what Emmanuel Marchant (Danone) termed ""Christmas lists""—into a few, actionable KPIs, though the exact number remained elusive. Muezz (WIPO) introduced a crucial, yet uncomfortable, dimension: the sovereign debt burden that forces African governments into export-oriented farming, undermining local food security and sustainability efforts. He pointed out that merely derisking private sector investment with public funds, without parallel institutional strengthening, could exacerbate exploitation. This sparked a debate with Alain (GCF), who showcased the Green Climate Fund's concessional finance model (grants, highly concessional loans, equity, and guarantees) designed to specifically attract and derisk private capital in high-risk, high-impact areas, arguing its necessity for achieving scale.

### Unforeseen Dimensions: Debt, Risk, and Ownership

Beyond the anticipated discussions, several less-explored dimensions surfaced. Leonardo Misi underscored 2025 as a critical, potentially disruptive year for global food geopolitics, suggesting an impending ""earthquake"" in food systems that demands immediate recalibration. Muezz's powerful articulation of sovereign debt as a primary structural barrier, hindering governments' capacity to invest in and steer agricultural development, exposed a blind spot often overlooked in purely agricultural policy discussions. Furthermore, the debate around derisking illuminated the ethical imperative of building robust local governance and ensuring equitable benefit-sharing to prevent private sector engagement from leading to exploitation, a concern Muezz directly articulated. Alain highlighted the GCF’s explicit strategy of strengthening and empowering local development banks as key partners, signaling a shift towards bolstering domestic financial ecosystems rather than solely relying on international financial institutions.

### The Strategic Takeaway: Beyond Business as Usual

The collective insight from the discussion firmly established that achieving a sustainable and food-secure future for Africa necessitates a radical departure from ""business as usual."" The strategic implication is clear: a successful transformation hinges on fostering African-led innovation, catalyzing significant, concessional investment (both public and derisked private), and integrating agriculture into a broader development agenda that addresses systemic issues like debt relief and strengthens national institutional capacities. Only through such integrated, locally owned, and financially inclusive approaches can Africa avert a deepening food crisis, unlock its immense agricultural potential, and meaningfully contribute to global stability and climate action.

Powering Prosperity: How Energy Access Drives Economic Transformation in Africa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMKRVNkV1TI,4 days ago,87 views,"## Energy as the Engine of Equitable Development: De-risking, De-Siloing, and Accelerating Africa's Just Transition

The global energy landscape is at a critical inflection point, where renewable sources are now economically competitive with and, in many cases, cheaper than fossil fuels. This discussion at the Paris Peace Forum, spearheaded by the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) and the Rockefeller Foundation, unveiled a primary thesis: energy access must transcend mere supply to become a direct catalyst for comprehensive economic growth and societal well-being. The central tension highlighted was the pervasive fragmentation in development efforts, underscoring an urgent need for integrated, multi-stakeholder approaches to unlock Africa's vast potential.

### Provocations & Keynotes: The Imperative for Integrated Energy Development

The core premise driving this discussion is the unprecedented economic viability of renewable energy. For the first time, renewable production delivers more energy than fossil fuels, with approximately 90% of renewables projects now proving cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. This pivotal moment presents an unparalleled opportunity for economic growth, particularly in developing nations, challenging the traditional development paradigm. The Rockefeller Foundation robustly articulated that coordinated investment in foundational energy infrastructure is not mere charity, but ""smart development economics,"" serving as a potent catalyst for human well-being and universal opportunity. This perspective directly provoked a critical examination of current development practices, particularly the widespread fragmentation where energy, agriculture, infrastructure, and health projects are often conceived and funded in silos. The consensus was clear: moving beyond these siloed approaches towards an integrated, system-level change is not only desirable but essential for a truly impactful and just energy transition.

### New Ideas & Proposals: Beyond Access to Impactful Integration

The discussion brought forth compelling models demonstrating how energy access can translate into tangible economic development. Carol, representing GEAPP's Africa operations, highlighted a crucial shift from merely providing energy supply to actively linking energy with productive uses. Her illustrative Nigerian case study showcased how integrating mini-grid power with productive-use equipment—such as cold storage for fishers or irrigation for farmers—created a ""perfect match"" that solved both demand deficits for power providers and energy gaps for equipment users, thereby stimulating local economic growth. Further, the Ethiopian coffee value chain exemplified how even minimal energy investment, like providing basic washing and pulping equipment, could significantly boost women farmers' incomes by over 30% through local value addition. The concept of ""venture building"" in nations like Kenya and Nigeria was presented as a promising avenue to foster private sector involvement, crucial for cultivating sustainable economic ecosystems around energy. Commissioner Simson reinforced this vision by advocating for a Pan-African electricity market, drawing parallels with Europe's interconnected grid to optimize resource utilization and enhance energy security across the continent.

### Debates & Fault Lines: Navigating the Challenges of Scale and Sovereignty

Despite the clear vision, significant obstacles and debates arose. William Tumwaku from the Ministry of Hydrocarbons in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) starkly illustrated the paradox of resource-rich nations grappling with energy poverty. Despite the DRC's immense hydroelectric potential, exceeding that of China's Three Gorges Dam, 90% of its population lacks electricity access. The DRC's ambitious goal of achieving 62% electricity access by 2030, underpinned by the monumental Inga Dam project, necessitates a staggering $37 billion investment, far surpassing national capacity. This funding gap exposed a critical fault line: the heavy reliance on external financing and the imperative for *significant policy and regulatory reforms* to attract and de-risk private capital. The pervasive fragmentation of funding, where multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other donors often focus on single sectors, was identified as a major barrier to holistic development. A strong consensus reiterated that ""access alone is not enough""; rather, coordinated, multi-sectoral investments are vital to maximize impact and prevent projects from languishing due to a lack of complementary infrastructure. Matt from AKDN further underscored the inherent complexity of large-scale, multi-country public-private partnerships, citing the 15-year, intricately negotiated Ruzizi project as evidence. He emphasized that the primary challenge is not the availability of capital itself, but the scarcity of *investable, ready-to-implement projects*, coupled with the immense burden of early-stage project development costs typically borne by private developers.

### The Unexpected & The Blind Spot: Beyond Traditional Metrics of Success

Beyond conventional financial and infrastructure debates, the discussion unearthed critical, often overlooked, dimensions of energy transition. Carol highlighted the persistent need for ""institutional strengthening"" and ""capacity building"" at the local level. Even with substantial funding, the absence of local skills to effectively *utilize* energy for economic development remains a critical gap, extending beyond mere technical training to fostering grassroots entrepreneurial ecosystems. Haya Al-Dhaheri from the Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) introduced the crucial lens of ""dignity"" and ""country sovereignty"" in project assessment. She detailed how QFFD's interventions prioritize not just sustainability and economic impact, but also aim to bolster local governance and ownership, as demonstrated by their foundational energy provision efforts in Syria's recovery. Rosalind from SIF raised the vital, yet often neglected, issue of ""debt awareness"" in energy transition financing. While blended finance and private capital mobilization are indispensable, she cautioned that an uncritical pursuit of funding without a thorough understanding of a country's existing debt context risks undermining the long-term sustainability of development gains. This calls for a nuanced financial realism, prioritizing *sustainable* capital flows over merely increasing debt, to ensure truly resilient development outcomes.

### Conclusion: The Strategic Takeaway - Forging a Collaborative Future for Global Energy Equity

The strategic implication of this discourse is clear: a just and impactful energy transition in Africa demands a fundamental paradigm shift from fragmented, project-centric aid to cohesive, system-level collaboration. This necessitates not only significant financial mobilization but also a radical de-complexification of investment processes, robust capacity building, and genuine country ownership. All these efforts must be underpinned by an acute awareness of local debt burdens and an unwavering commitment to transforming energy access into a truly equitable engine of sustainable prosperity across the continent."
Reshuffling of the World Order: What Role for the “Middle Powers”?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFPLJKKlfJk,4 days ago,241 views,"## The Shifting Global Chessboard: Middle Powers Asserting Agency Amidst Polycentric Transition

The Paris Peace Forum panel underscored a profound reordering of global power dynamics, moving beyond a bipolar or unipolar construct towards a complex, multipolar system where ""middle powers"" increasingly redefine both regional and international stability. The central tension revealed was the simultaneous indispensability and unreliability of traditional great powers, forcing a new strategic calculus upon states previously considered secondary actors. This discussion illuminated not merely a transition, but a deliberate assertion of agency by these middle-tier states, reshaping the very ""texture and essence of the world system"" through diversified partnerships and the active construction of resilient regional orders.

### The Emerging Global Equation

Michel Duclos and Soli Ozel, framing the discussion within the ""Trump era,"" set the stage for a critical examination of how middle powers are compelled to seek new avenues for cooperation and self-organization amidst an increasingly volatile international backdrop. Dino Patti Djalal then introduced a pivotal distinction: while the 20th century witnessed a quantitative expansion of nation-states, the 21st century is marked by a profound qualitative shift in the *distribution of power*. He defined middle powers by their ""middleweight capacity in economic, diplomatic, military, and technological terms,"" identifying a growing cohort of states like Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey, and others as pivotal players. Djalal provocatively suggested that a prevalent Western fixation on China’s rise as the singular force shaping the next world order risks overlooking the collective and transformative impact of these two to three dozen middle powers. Concurrently, Dubai Abulhoul asserted that the geopolitical gravitas of the Middle East has decisively migrated to Gulf capitals, transforming them from peripheral actors into central hubs for regional diplomacy and mediation, a shift she argued reflects a conscious internal re-evaluation of agency rather than passive external influence. Brazil’s Cesar Cunha Campos positioned his nation's role within the BRICS framework as an aspiration for a more inclusive and representative global order, explicitly rejecting the notion of constructing a ""non-Western"" alternative in favor of a balanced, multilateral paradigm. Finally, Galip Dalay underscored how regional conflicts, such as the Syrian crisis for Turkey, serve as microcosms reflecting deeper global restructuring, thereby compelling middle powers to fundamentally re-evaluate their strategic allegiances and perceptions of major powers.

### Strategies for Self-Determination

A core proposal articulated by Dino Patti Djalal posits the world order as an aggregate of regional orders, where the successful consolidation and self-assertion of regional blocs, exemplified by ASEAN, fundamentally alter global dynamics. He contended that middle powers are the architects of these evolving regional orders, demonstrating their autonomy by dictating engagement terms to major global players. Complementing this, Dubai Abulhoul unveiled a ""new doctrine of self-management"" for Gulf states, advocating for homegrown collective security paradigms rooted in strategic confidence rather than full alignment. This doctrine is evidenced by a notable pivot towards robust intra-Gulf dialogue and regional de-escalation, occasionally facilitated by external mediation under new auspices. Abulhoul highlighted the Gulf's unique ""convening power"" as a neutral ground capable of hosting diverse global actors, transcending mere prestige to signify a profound shift in geopolitical influence. Cesar Cunha Campos presented BRICS not as a monolithic counter-alliance, but as a flexible, dialogue-oriented forum enabling balanced cooperation focused on economic growth and inclusive governance, despite inherent ideological and strategic differences among its members. Brazil, in this context, positions itself as a crucial ""bridge between North and South,"" fostering understanding over polarization. Dalay, from Turkey, introduced a nuanced strategic framework: while a short-term approach for middle powers might necessitate ""doubling down"" on existing, even unreliable, alliances, the long-term imperative lies in broad strategic diversification across multiple partners. He pointed to an unexpected opportunity for European defense industries, as middle powers seek to diversify their defense procurement away from US, Chinese, or Russian sources without antagonizing major players. Furthermore, Japan, through Tanaka-Yoko, presented its ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" (FOIP) vision not as an exclusive regional bloc, but as a global connectivity initiative promoting trust, transparency, and the rule of law across diverse continents. Japan’s approach emphasizes providing global public goods and acting as a ""quiet stabilizer"" through cooperation rather than the imposition of power, deftly integrating economic security with technological innovation.

### Contested Architectures and Internal Divides

A significant fault line emerged regarding the perceived reliability of traditional great powers, particularly the United States. While Djalal and Cunha Campos acknowledged a global transition, Abulhoul and Dalay explicitly articulated a shared sentiment among Gulf states and Turkey: the US, despite its undeniable indispensability in crisis management, is increasingly viewed as an unreliable sole security guarantor, thereby necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of existing security architectures. The inherent differences within multilateral blocs like BRICS also revealed potential for internal friction. While Cunha Campos advocated for BRICS as a platform for inclusion and balance, the discussion acknowledged the divergent strategic objectives of its founding members—ranging from China’s quest for global influence and Russia’s drive for diplomatic relevance to India’s multi-aligned multilateralism—underscoring the potential for internal clashes despite a shared commitment to non-confrontational dialogue. Abulhoul’s analysis of the distinct ""political grammars"" within the GCC further highlighted regional fault lines, where, despite a shared strategic imperative for collective stability, individual states (e.g., KSA's domestic focus versus UAE's pragmatic balancing versus Qatar's mediation) pursue divergent foreign policy approaches. Dalay’s nuanced assessment of US-Turkey relations, particularly concerning Syria, illuminated the complex interplay of perceived reliability and strategic necessity. His initial characterization of US unreliability and Russia's predictability was later tempered by an acknowledgment of shifting realities, showcasing the fluidity of middle power foreign policy in response to evolving geopolitical facts.

### Unforeseen Trajectories and Strategic Gaps

A critical ""blind spot"" identified by Dino Patti Djalal was the prevailing Western over-focus on China as the singular force reshaping the next world order, an analytical myopia that risks overlooking the aggregated, transformative impact of numerous middle powers across various regions. Abulhoul’s observation that the Gulf region has evolved into a unique ""convening power,"" capable of hosting both Global North and South actors without the encumbrance of historical baggage, signals an unexpected and significant shift in diplomatic influence, moving beyond mere prestige to assert a novel geopolitical role. Cunha Campos’s assertion that Brazil, by understanding both ""poor and rich countries,"" occupies a unique position as a mediator and bridge-builder, highlights a role often underestimated in traditional power analyses focused predominantly on economic or military might. Dalay’s provocative framework of a ""short-term bribe, long-term diversify"" approach for engaging with the United States, while candid in its bluntness, transparently illustrates the transactional realities and strategic calculations that middle powers must undertake to secure their interests in a volatile environment. An unexpected yet crucial insight emerged regarding the burgeoning opportunity for European defense industries, as middle powers seek to diversify their defense procurement away from US, Chinese, or Russian sources, often to avoid antagonizing major players, thus creating new avenues for European engagement. Finally, the consistent emphasis across multiple speakers on the transition from reliance on external security guarantors to the development of ""homegrown collective security paradigms"" points to a fundamental, and perhaps underestimated, shift in how states are reconceptualizing their sovereignty and defense in an increasingly multipolar world.

### A New Era of Collective Action

The panel discussions illuminate a nascent but robust assertion of agency by middle powers, collectively demanding a more equitable and representative global order. Their strategic calculus is increasingly shaped by a need to navigate the paradox of great power influence—simultaneously indispensable and unreliable—necessitating diversified partnerships and the deliberate construction of resilient regional orders. This mandates a fundamental reassessment by established powers of their engagement strategies, recognizing that future global stability hinges not on traditional hierarchical structures, but on a collaborative, polycentric approach to global governance."
Peacekeeping at a Crossroads: The Future of UN Missions and Global Responsibility,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxM52LmGqE,4 days ago,341 views,"## Rethinking UN Peacekeeping: Kosovo's Mandate for Democracy and Development in a Decentralized World

The ongoing global proliferation of complex conflicts challenges the very efficacy and relevance of established international peace and security mechanisms, particularly UN peacekeeping missions. This conversation, featuring Prime Minister Albin Kurti of the Republic of Kosovo, critically examined whether the current UN model remains a viable instrument for maintaining international peace and security or has, as many critics contend, reached its operational limits. The central tension that emerged from the discussion posits that the UN's future viability hinges upon a radical re-evaluation of its mandate, shifting from traditional peacekeeping towards a holistic, locally-owned peacebuilding paradigm rooted in democratic development and economic prosperity, thereby reflecting a broader, decentralized architecture of collective security.

Prime Minister Kurti opened by affirming that the greatest achievement of the 20th century, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inherently guides the United Nations' enduring mission to uphold human dignity through universal principles of equality. However, he sharply distinguished between mere peacekeeping and transformative peacebuilding, arguing that successful UN missions necessitate ""clear goals, local support, and a time frame,"" unequivocally rejecting any notion of an ""interim without a deadline."" Peacekeeping, in his view, primarily involves securing and defending peace, often through military presence to ensure ""safety and security for all."" In contrast, peacebuilding demands the cultivation of ""institutions of the system and social awareness,"" fostering ""democratic institutions"" and a ""vibrant society where critical thinking and thriving debates are part of everyday life,"" extending beyond military considerations to encompass broader societal development. The implication is clear: many current UN operations, while perhaps maintaining a fragile peace, fail to address the underlying structural conditions necessary for sustainable stability.

Kosovo's extensive experience with international missions serves as a potent case study. Kurti acknowledged the initial success of the UN mission (UNMIK) in its early humanitarian phase, particularly in facilitating refugee return and ensuring basic human security immediately following the 1999 conflict. However, he critically noted that when the mandate shifted towards ""democracy and development,"" UNMIK proved less effective, becoming ""more of a liability than an opportunity."" This failure stemmed partly from an overreach of ""executive powers"" often wielded by international peacekeepers, powers they ""should not have"" and are ""not supposed to enjoy,"" which frequently lacked defined scope. Kurti stressed the imperative for leadership possessing a deep ""sensitivity of a sociologist or anthropologist,"" understanding local dynamics and prioritizing public legitimacy alongside operational efficiency. The micro-management by the UN office in New York and the geopolitical maneuvering of certain ""non-democratic superpowers"" within the Security Council were identified as significant impediments to Kosovo's self-determination and long-term democratic institution-building.

Looking ahead, the discussion turned to the evolving architecture of collective security, with increasing reliance on regional and sub-regional organizations. Prime Minister Kurti expressed skepticism about the UN Security Council's capacity to effectively address complex challenges due to its limited membership, including ""two non-democratic"" permanent members, which frequently prioritize ""common interests"" over ""shared values."" He contended that issues must be resolved proactively, or peacekeeping mandates should be strictly confined to their original humanitarian and security scope. The Kosovo model, where a declining NATO military presence coincided with a dramatic six-fold increase in GDP per capita since 2000, illustrates the necessity of a ""macroeconomic dividend"" to ensure liberation and independence translate into tangible improvements in the ""livelihood of families and society as a whole."" In this decentralized landscape, Kurti highlighted the European Union as a formidable example of successful multilateralism, describing it as the ""most important and successful political project and historical process of peace and prosperity since Second World War."" He suggested that the UN could glean significant lessons from the EU's convergence and multi-layered cooperation.

Ultimately, Kosovo's trajectory is presented as a ""double success story"": both a result of NATO's humanitarian military intervention to prevent genocide and a testament to the symbiotic relationship between ""development and democracy going hand-in-hand."" This narrative directly challenges authoritarian perspectives that decouple economic progress from democratic governance, arguing that true development is intrinsically linked to human rights and the impartial rule of law. Kurti advocated for platforms like the Paris Peace Forum, which intentionally include all nations, not just the traditional power blocs, to foster dialogue on historical grievances and future aspirations. Kosovo’s determined pursuit of EU and NATO integration, despite non-recognition from some states, demonstrates its commitment to shared democratic values and its growing capabilities as a security contributor, exceeding NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target for three consecutive years.

The strategic implication is that the prevailing model of UN peacekeeping is no longer fit for purpose in an increasingly complex and decentralized global security environment. Future international interventions must transition from externally imposed peacekeeping to internally generated peacebuilding, prioritizing local ownership, democratic institution-building, economic development, and adherence to shared values. The UN's comparative advantage may increasingly lie in its normative and legitimizing roles, fostering multilateral dialogue and agreement, while deferring operational deployment to more agile, regionally-embedded organizations like the EU or NATO. This demands a fundamental reform of global governance structures to genuinely empower emerging democracies and smaller states, leveraging their unique experiences to forge a more inclusive and effective collective security architecture."
Powering Change: Clean Energy Solutions for Resilient Communities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRGFl0dDJ2E,4 days ago,44 views,"## Beyond Kilowatt-Hours: Empowering Resilient Communities Through Integrated Clean Energy Solutions

The Paris Peace Forum recently convened experts to deliberate on clean energy solutions for resilient communities, immediately foregrounding a critical tension: the imperative of localized, multi-dimensional energy interventions against a backdrop of systemic barriers to equitable scaling and sustainable financing. This panel revealed a consensus that genuine energy resilience extends far beyond mere electricity provision, deeply intertwining with social, economic, and environmental development.

Innovators like Mario Aguilera of Tespack and Martha Mukai of Darubini Yafya presented compelling models that exemplify this multi-dimensional approach. Aguilera detailed Tespack's mobile micro-grid systems, delivering not only power but also internet connectivity for educational projects in remote areas, highlighting the profound social and cultural factors that underpin successful implementation. Mukai further elucidated this holistic vision with Darubini Yafya's process, transforming agricultural waste and plastics into clean fuel for schools and biochar for farmers. She argued passionately that tackling issues like energy access, health, nutrition, and environmental sustainability cannot be compartmentalized by funders, as ""the user ... needs the energy and the soil fertility for their crops,"" necessitating integrated support.

A significant challenge articulated by both Aguilera and Onyekachi Nwator of KatexPower centered on the pervasive disconnect between high-level decision-makers and the on-the-ground realities of vulnerable communities. Aguilera observed that those allocating budgets often ""do not understand in detail what are the issues that are happening,"" creating a chasm that prevents appropriate technology from reaching those who need it most. Nwator echoed this, emphasizing KatexPower's strategy of deep community engagement to understand specific energy needs, coupled with extensive training programs that empower local youth and women to install, maintain, and even distribute solar home systems. This crucial empowerment, according to Nwator, fosters community ownership and mitigates future dependencies, moving beyond mere provision to genuine self-sufficiency.

Ma Jun from the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs offered a macro perspective from China, showcasing the immense, rapid deployment of renewable energy—surpassing 2030 wind and solar targets six years early. While acknowledging the scale of centralized projects, he also highlighted the ""hundreds of thousands"" of distributed solar initiatives. Yet, this aggressive expansion introduces new complexities, such as integrating highly volatile renewable sources into existing grids, sometimes necessitating traditional coal-fired power as backup. Ma Jun underscored the need for sophisticated data collection, AI, and smart grid technologies to manage this transition, alongside a critical awareness of the ""downside"" of renewable development, including land use, biodiversity impacts, and the looming challenge of end-of-life waste management for solar panels, stressing the urgency for circular economy principles.

The strategic imperative emerging from this discussion is clear: the global clean energy transition demands a profound shift from siloed, technology-first approaches to integrated, context-specific solutions. Realizing this requires concerted efforts in robust technology transfer and local manufacturing to avert new forms of dependency, as advocated by Aguilera, and innovative financing models like Nwator’s ""pay-as-you-go"" system, to bridge the gap between financial capital and community needs. Ultimately, successful clean energy deployment must prioritize community engagement, capacity building, and ownership, ensuring that the benefits of a decarbonized future are equitable, sustainable, and truly empowering for all."
Empowering Youth Networks to Defend Democracy and Global Peace,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZh0ZHzL388,4 days ago,78 views,"## Bridging the Chasm: Empowering Youth as the Central Pillar of Sustainable Peace and Democratic Resilience

The Paris Peace Forum's panel on ""The Power of Youth in Conflict-Affected Countries"" transcended a mere acknowledgment of youth, instead establishing them as indispensable, if often undervalued, architects of peace and democratic change. The core tension revealed in the discussion lies in the urgent need to bridge the prevailing perception of youth as either recipients of aid or sources of disruption, with practical, systemic support that integrates their inherent agency at every level of global decision-making. This necessitates a fundamental shift from tokenistic consultation to genuine, protected partnership in peacebuilding.

The panel underscored the critical need to fundamentally alter the lens through which youth are perceived and engaged. As Benedikta von Seherr-Thoß highlighted, young people, comprising over 40% of the world's population, are ""not just the future, they are powerful agents of change today,"" despite over 400 million living amidst conflict. Damir Hasanović directly challenged the prevailing view, arguing that youth movements, often born from democratic deficits in countries like Serbia, are too frequently seen as ""a challenge to authority"" rather than vital contributions. He observed that youth-led protests often bypass traditional political landscapes to directly champion ""core democratic values,"" demonstrating a unique agility and commitment to foundational principles. His involvement with the UNDP Serbia's ""Youth 4 Inclusion, Equality and Trust Peacebuilding"" initiative further illustrated how youth networks can effectively unite disparate regions, fostering stability through practical, grassroots initiatives that transcend symbolic gestures.

Damares Guaza Sandoval provided powerful, ground-up insights from Latin America, demonstrating the diverse and deeply rooted nature of youth peacebuilding. In Cauca, Colombia, indigenous youth actively protect ""territory, culture, and human rights"" through peaceful collective action, while Afro-descendant youth reclaim ""historical memory"" and ""promote peace through art and education."" She detailed how in Chiapas, Mexico, young people bravely defend natural resources against organized crime, intrinsically linking ""spirituality and indigenous identity to the land."" Critically, Sandoval broadened the definition of peace itself, stating that for these communities, it is ""more than the absence of conflict or war""; it embodies ""justice, opportunity, and dignity,"" where young people can express their truth ""without fear"" and everyone is treated with respect irrespective of their background, moving beyond narrow security paradigms.

Ilgin Pasli Brombacher further elucidated the systemic challenges, noting the profound paradox that youth, while bearing the heaviest burdens of conflict, are often ""the least trusted with the solutions."" She critiqued existing consultation models where youth ideas are frequently ""shelved,"" deeming such practices not only frustrating but ""dangerous."" Brombacher identified three crucial strengths of youth networks: their **speed with legitimacy**, stemming from their horizontal and local nature, which allows them to ""act quickly to respond to crisis"" and imbues their messages with local resonance; their **bridging power**, enabling connections between formal and informal structures, online and offline engagement, and policy with practice, thereby depolarizing and empowering; and their commitment to **bottom-up peacebuilding**, which, through violence prevention and community-led resilience, ""contributes to rebuilding social trust, social cohesion, and leading to reconciliation across generations,"" establishing long-term peace. Her personal narrative, overcoming silencing in Turkey through empowerment from a youth-led training, underscored the transformative capacity of these networks, exemplified by the Youth Peace Ambassadors Network's training of over 4,500 youth globally.

The urgency of translating this recognition into action was starkly underlined by the discussion on protection. Brombacher highlighted the alarming reality that a youth delegate to the Council of Europe's Congress was recently arrested following an intervention, questioning how youth can be expected to ""take lead"" if they ""are afraid of their lives."" Hasanović reiterated that ""participation"" within the Youth, Peace and Security (YPS) agenda remains largely unfulfilled, with youth often reduced to a mere ""quota to be met"" rather than genuinely consulted for policy-making. Both Sandoval and Brombacher articulated clear pathways forward, advocating for strengthening democratic institutions, supporting youth-led documentation, and establishing ""emergency windows"" within dedicated and flexible funding mechanisms that ""arrive in the speed of reality."" They further emphasized constant, needs-driven capacity development for youth organizations and, crucially, ""youth-sensitive and gender-responsive training for officials"" to foster a more inclusive and protective environment for youth peacebuilders globally.

The strategic imperative is unequivocal: youth must be recognized and supported not merely as beneficiaries or external consultants, but as full and equal partners and leaders at the very core of peacebuilding. This demands a profound reorientation of international policy frameworks, funding mechanisms, and institutional cultures to proactively integrate youth agency, ensuring their safety, and amplifying their unique capacities to forge more just, resilient, and enduring peace."
High-Level International Conference on Information Integrity and Independent Media [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0WnPNMnpjs,4 days ago,92 views,"## The Looming Algorithmic Peril: Safeguarding Information Integrity in an Age of Disinformation and AI

The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence, especially generative AI, heralds a new era of profound challenges to the very fabric of information integrity, democratic processes, and public trust. This discussion at the Paris Peace Forum underscored a palpable tension between the transformative potential of these technologies and their capacity to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities within media ecosystems. The core contention is whether humanity can collectively navigate this digital frontier to harness AI's benefits while effectively countering the sophisticated, scaled, and culturally ingrained threats it poses to a shared, factual reality.

Mark Thompson, representing the International Fund for Public Interest Media (IFPIM), framed the urgency unequivocally: ""we are in a real battle here... a battle which is currently being lost in most countries."" This erosion of reliable information is not merely a crisis for media organizations, but a systemic failure where ""the public are losing, citizens are losing,"" impacting everything from global health and climate action to peace and security. He delineated three ""interlocking threats"": political/cultural shifts towards narrative-based, self-serving truths; an economic crisis for news media due to digital disruption; and a technological environment where platforms either ""do too little"" or ""actively add harm"" by prioritizing engagement with dramatic falsehoods. This alarming trend, once considered a ""developing world problem,"" is now ""creeping into every developed world as well,"" leading Nobel laureate Maria Ressa to lament the ""collapsing"" of our shared reality, without which no other global challenge can be effectively addressed.

Paula Miraglia, CEO of Momentum, echoed these concerns, detailing AI's direct impact on journalism's viability. She warned of a ""traffic apocalypse,"" where generative AI provides answers directly, bypassing traditional news websites and thereby stripping media organizations of crucial revenue streams. This absence of organic traffic intensifies market concentration, making media susceptible to capture by political, religious, or commercial interests, including a concerning reliance on sports betting companies for advertising. Beyond economic vulnerability, the relationship between media and tech platforms is characterized by a profound ""asymmetry of power."" Media organizations, already reeling from a ""historical crisis,"" are forced into licensing agreements that are ""extremely unfair,"" granting unprecedented control over their content to AI companies while receiving negligible compensation or transparency regarding distribution.

Adding a critical layer to the discussion, Dr. Shikoh Gitau, CEO of KoaLa, illuminated how generative AI amplifies and entrenches existing biases, particularly against underrepresented communities. She cited startling examples: AI models generating a ""giraffe doctor"" (a reference to the Madagascar movie) instead of an African doctor treating a white child, or producing geographically inaccurate maps of Africa. This systemic misrepresentation stems from the alarming fact that only 2% of African datasets currently inform global generative AI models, effectively erasing the continent's rich linguistic and cultural diversity (over 2,300 languages, yet only 40 represented in AI). This ""digital colonialism"" demands a proactive, Africa-led approach to defining its AI narrative, building models *from* Africa and *for* Africa, and prioritizing inclusive datasets, talent development, and robust governance frameworks.

Faced with these multi-faceted threats, the forum explored concerted counter-strategies. Camille Grenier of the Forum on Information and Democracy emphasized the need for ""coalitions of action"" alongside policy recommendations, announcing new coordination groups with multilateral organizations and states to strengthen democratic information ecosystems. Kimi Younes of TV5MONDE advocated for robust public service media producing ""quality content by experts, produced by professional journalists"" as the most effective antidote to disinformation. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, stressed the imperative of governments to regulate platforms and foster public trust, viewing climate disinformation as part of a larger ""cultural battle"" against truth. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation highlighted the critical role of non-profit digital public goods like Wikipedia, which rely on volunteer communities to ensure content quality and defend against manipulation, offering a stark contrast to the profit-driven models of big tech. Her ""Wikipedia test"" calls for policy scrutiny to ensure regulations do not inadvertently harm public interest technology.

The strategic implication of this ongoing ""battle for truth"" is nothing less than the preservation of a functional global society. Without a collective commitment to fostering information integrity and supporting independent media, the very foundation of democratic discourse, evidence-based policymaking, and shared human understanding will crumble. Governments, civil society, media organizations, and tech innovators must coalesce around transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance models for AI, actively challenging existing power asymmetries and prioritizing diverse representation in data. The future of global stability hinges on whether we can collectively rebalance the scales, ensuring that reliable information, rather than algorithmic manipulation, serves as the bedrock for collective action and human progress."
Minerals Partnerships for a Sustainable Future: Ensuring Mutually Beneficial [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1FYEELl3Ok,4 days ago,59 views,"## Unlocking Africa's Mineral Wealth: Forging Inclusive Value Chains for Sustainable Industrialization

The discourse surrounding Africa's critical mineral resources has shifted from mere extraction to a concerted push for genuine, sustainable industrialization. This panel convened to explore the pathways toward mutually beneficial mineral partnerships, underscoring the continent’s pivotal role in global energy and digital transitions. The core thesis that emerged is a complex one: despite holding over a third of the world's critical minerals, Africa grapples with a paradox where its immense resource wealth has yet to translate into widespread economic prosperity, demanding a fundamental re-evaluation of current partnership models to foster inclusive value chains and drive transformative development.

Emmanuel Makumba Mau, representing the ICGLR, starkly highlighted Africa's current predicament, revealing that the continent captures less than 3% of global mineral trade despite producing 30-35% of essential critical minerals. He asserted that while industrialization is undeniably a critical pillar for regional transformation, current partnerships suffer from inherent weaknesses. These agreements frequently prioritize the *delivery* of raw materials to destination markets over robust mechanisms for *production integration* and *regional complementarities* within Africa itself. Makumba Mau further underscored the pervasive issues of instability and conflict, particularly in regions like Eastern DRC, where minerals often fuel, rather than alleviate, conflict—a fact acknowledged by the Lusaka Declaration. Crucially, he pointed to a systemic lack of investment in foundational infrastructure (energy, transport, communication) and a disregard for human rights, good governance, and equitable financial benefit sharing, which collectively undermine political stability and shared prosperity, leaving youth and women vulnerable.

Marietta Jaeger from the European Commission affirmed the EU's commitment to Africa as a primary partner, recognizing the continent's colossal potential spanning its youthful population, abundant solar resources, and critical mineral deposits. She emphasized the EU’s support for Africa's economic integration, notably through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), as a vital engine for industrialization. Through its Critical Raw Materials Act and strategic partnerships, the EU aims to foster a ""win-win"" scenario, not merely securing its own strategic autonomy and diversified supply, but actively supporting Africa's economic and industrial development. This involves extensive training, skills development aligned with ESG standards, infrastructure investment, and research and development, executed within a ""360-degree approach"" that is consistently aligned with African partners' national priorities. Yet, Jaeger conceded that the ultimate success of these enabling efforts hinges on the active engagement of the private sector and the realization of tangible business opportunities, with a renewed focus on local value creation beyond simple extraction, extending to processing within African nations.

Bandi Mbubi of the Fair Cobalt Alliance acknowledged the positive strides made in mineral traceability since the early 2000s, where companies are increasingly held accountable for their sourcing practices. However, he cautioned against a superficial approach, noting the perversion of certification systems that sometimes serve merely to ""clean up"" supply chains legally rather than fostering genuine ethical conduct. A significant criticism, he argued, is the continued exclusion of local communities from decision-making processes, where standards are often imposed rather than co-created. The FCA, in response, has pioneered an alliance model in regions like Lualaba (DRC), actively involving mining companies, technology providers, and local civil society. This collaborative approach seeks to transform artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) practices, improving working conditions, addressing child labor, and ensuring that local communities are integral to the value chain, demonstrating that responsible mining can indeed deliver prosperity when inclusivity is prioritized. Vincent Duref from Imerys further reinforced the industry's role, highlighting the imperative for responsible mining practices, environmental stewardship (especially in less regulated contexts), and a robust social license to operate. He articulated Imerys's commitment to local industrialization through fostering local business development and investing in skills training, underscoring that such practices are not mere philanthropy but ""good business"" that ultimately benefits all stakeholders.

The ""So what?"" of this discussion is clear: realizing Africa's immense critical mineral potential for sustainable industrialization requires a paradigm shift from donor-recipient or purely extractive relationships to integrated, truly equitable partnerships. These must embed robust governance, human rights, environmental stewardship, local value addition, and inclusive community participation—especially for women and youth—from inception. Development finance, as highlighted by Sven Renner (World Bank), needs to move beyond traditional funding to innovative instruments that de-risk investment in smelting and refining, fostering a connected ecosystem where mining acts as an anchor for broader infrastructure and economic development. As Adnane El Kitri of OCP Group demonstrated, a century-old company, such partnerships are achievable through long-term win-win agreements, comprehensive ecosystems around mines, significant investment in local knowledge and research (like UM6P), financial services for local farmers, and substantial commitments to low-carbon infrastructure and green energy, emphasizing that this collaborative government-private sector approach is the only viable path to attract the necessary capital and achieve a truly transformative mineral-driven future for Africa.**Africa's Mineral Paradox: Reconciling Extraction Potential with Inclusive Industrialization through Equitable Partnerships**

AI Transparency Across the Value Chain: Lessons from the HAIP Reporting Framework,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDWLFHPQH8,4 days ago,47 views,"## The Imperative of Actionable AI Transparency: Navigating Risk and Fostering Global Interoperability Through the Hiroshima Framework

In an era characterized by profound geopolitical shifts, recurrent political and economic crises, and escalating social unrest, the exponential growth of Artificial Intelligence presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant global risks. This pivotal discussion, hosted by the Paris Peace Forum, critically examined the G7's Hiroshima AI Process and its associated Reporting Framework, revealing a nuanced landscape where voluntary international coordination seeks to bridge aspirational principles with concrete, actionable transparency. The central tension highlighted throughout the panel lay in balancing the urgent demand for a globally harmonized approach to AI governance with the practical complexities of achieving widespread, consistent, and adaptable implementation across diverse stakeholders and national regulatory systems.

The OECD, a driving force behind global AI principles since 2019, underscored the foundational role of transparency, with Karine Perset noting that the Hiroshima Framework now translates these principles into practice as the first international, voluntary, and comparable mechanism for organizations to manage AI risks. Initial reports, though nascent, reveal three encouraging patterns: a growing alignment of corporate AI governance with recognized standards like the OECD AI Principles, EU AI Act, and NIST Risk Management Framework, signifying shared approaches across borders; a marked increase in the sharpness of transparency through tailored disclosures, including public model cards and deeper technical reports, fostering greater openness on incidents and lessons learned; and a significant rise in investment in AI safety, with organizations actively partnering with researchers and civil society on critical areas such as explainability, provenance, and reliability. This collaborative momentum signals a nascent but robust commitment to continuous improvement in AI risk management.

Expanding on the strategic implications, Japan, through Yuchi Tsuji, emphasized the Hiroshima AI Process as a crucial multi-stakeholder platform designed to transform high-level principles into tangible actions. Japan's active role in establishing and expanding the ""Friends Group,"" now comprising 58 countries and regions, alongside a ""Partners Community"" that includes the private sector and international organizations, highlights a concerted effort to foster broader global engagement and collaboration. Aurélien Palix, representing the French Ministry of Economy, articulated the dual value proposition for governments: incentivizing transparency among AI developers is paramount for building public trust and enabling effective integration of AI into public services, while simultaneously boosting market competitiveness by fostering confidence among AI adopters. Crucially, the non-binding nature of the Hiroshima process, while inherently risky if engagement wanes, has demonstrated its capacity to yield tangible results, offering a flexible yet impactful alternative to purely regulatory frameworks, particularly appealing to regions like Europe.

However, the panel also illuminated significant evolving challenges and critical areas for future development. Hector de Rivoire of Microsoft underscored the persistent ""black box"" perception of AI and the urgent need for harmonized, operational transparency tools that address increasingly complex threats like data poisoning, prompt injection, and agentic AI security. His call for a two-way flow of information, where developers report upstream risks and deployers feed back real-world insights, is vital for improving model design across the entire value chain. James Geely of Safer AI stressed the imperative of maintaining a clear focus on advanced and frontier AI systems within the framework, warning against dilution that could compromise its original intent to address systemic risks. He also advocated for clear risk acceptability criteria and ""red lines"" established through global dialogue, recognizing the exponential pace of AI capabilities that necessitates rapid, adaptive governance. The overarching consensus points to the need for tailored reporting mechanisms that cater to diverse roles (developers, deployers, SMEs) and sectors, alongside continuous technical updates to ensure the framework remains a living, interoperable reference point in an ever-accelerating technological landscape.

Ultimately, the Hiroshima AI Process represents a vital, albeit evolving, foundation for a more transparent and trustworthy global AI ecosystem. Its strategic implication lies in its capacity to serve as a multi-stakeholder platform that not only codifies best practices but actively fosters collaboration and learning. As countries develop their unique regulatory approaches, ensuring interoperability and sustained engagement—especially from the Global South, smaller actors, and the front lines of AI development—will be critical. The path forward demands a commitment to modularity, allowing for the integration of diverse regional concerns within a shared framework, thereby bridging the gap between high-level ethical aspirations and the operational realities of AI development and deployment in a rapidly changing world."
Rebalancing Global Order: Can Europe Find its Voice?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOKp1Yz_NhY,4 days ago,94 views,"## Europe's Unwavering Imperative: From Denial to Decisive Action in a Fractured World

The recent Paris Peace Forum panel, bringing together ministers responsible for European affairs from Germany, Poland, and France, starkly illuminated Europe's profound re-evaluation of its global standing and the urgent necessity for a cohesive, assertive foreign policy. Amidst a geopolitical landscape characterized by escalating competition and conflict, the central tension revolved around Europe's capacity to transcend historical naivete and internal friction to forge a singular, powerful voice on the world stage, with a palpable sense of urgency permeating the discussions.

The debate underscored a critical intersection between economic competitiveness and geopolitical vulnerability. Gunther Krichbaum, Germany's Minister of State for Europe, detailed how Europe confronts multifaceted external pressures, citing China's ""unfair"" trade practices, exemplified by a German foreign minister's postponed visit due to Beijing's recalcitrance, and the continent's dependency on critical resources like semiconductors from Taiwan. Simultaneously, he noted the shift from ""America First"" to an ""America Only"" posture from the United States, evidenced by unilateral tariffs that even impacted non-EU states like Switzerland, further highlighting the fraying of traditional alliances and the erosion of multilateral frameworks like the WTO. Internally, Krichbaum lamented the debilitating effect of excessive bureaucracy, arguing that the continent ""does not have the time"" or energy to contend with self-imposed administrative burdens and internal squabbles that impede vital reforms. This sentiment was echoed by Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, who linked Europe's sovereignty directly to its competitiveness, asserting that the continent must reduce strategic dependencies to ""write our own history"" in critical sectors like technology and defense, moving beyond the ""happy globalization of the 1990s"" mindset. Ignacy Niemczycki, Poland's Secretary of State, emphatically called for greater European unity and assertiveness, stressing that no single member state, particularly Poland, can unilaterally confront a state-subsidized economic power like China, necessitating a unified ""de-risking"" strategy rather than unrealistic decoupling.

The discourse also revealed a stark awakening to the realities of security and defense, moving from a period of denial to a recognition of imminent threats. Krichbaum pointedly criticized Europe's past naivete regarding Russia, noting that nations like Poland and the Baltics, with their historical experiences, exhibited a more realistic understanding of the Kremlin's intentions, even as early as the 2014 annexation of Crimea. He starkly declared that the era of ""cheap goods from China, cheap energy from Russia, and cheap security from the United States"" is definitively over, underscoring that Europe is neither at war nor entirely at peace, facing a spectrum of threats from cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns to infrastructure vulnerabilities. Niemczycki underscored Poland's significant defense spending, now approaching 5% of its GDP, as a direct response to this immediate threat, yet cautioned against a dangerous ""normalization"" of the conflict in Ukraine among some European populations, which blinds them to a ""very real threat in the near future."" Haddad echoed this, asserting that the notion of ""war is back"" is misleading, as conflict never truly left the European continent, citing the Western Balkans, Georgia, and Crimea as precursors. He emphasized the paradoxical challenge for the EU: its success as a peace project has ill-prepared it for a world of zero-sum geopolitical competition, demanding a dual approach that upholds its founding principles while developing the capacity to defend them.

Despite these sobering assessments, a collective determination to project European values and interests, and a flicker of optimism, persisted. The panel broadly agreed that free trade, far from being dead, remains a vital tool for diversification, particularly through new agreements like CETA with Canada and JEFTA with Japan, as highlighted by Krichbaum, who championed Europe’s 450-million-consumer market as an unparalleled asset. However, Niemczycki and Haddad introduced crucial caveats: future trade agreements must be modernized with ""safeguard clauses"" and ""mirror clauses"" to ensure fair competition and prevent the import of goods that do not adhere to European standards, thereby protecting sensitive domestic sectors from unfair external pressures. On security, while unanimous in their confidence in NATO's Article 5, the speakers, particularly Krichbaum and Haddad, stressed the increasing importance of the EU's own Article 42.7 (solidarity in security), and the imperative for Europeans to become ""strong, self-reliant allies"" to ensure a mature transatlantic partnership, especially given the US pivot to Asia. Niemczycki passionately concluded with a call to action for Europe's youth, urging them to engage in public life to protect the continent's enduring values of democracy, human rights, and rule of law, reminding all that despite current challenges, Europe remains ""the best place to live in the world,"" a testament to the enduring power of its ideals.

The overarching strategic takeaway from this exchange is that Europe stands at a critical inflection point, no longer able to afford the luxury of geopolitical passivity or internal disunity. The confluence of economic competition, direct security threats, and the erosion of the post-Cold War order demands an urgent, unified, and decisive shift from reactive denial to proactive strategic autonomy. This entails not only significant investment in defense and industrial capabilities but also a concerted effort to streamline governance, enforce fair trade, and champion its democratic values both internally and on the global stage, solidifying its role as a resilient and indispensable geopolitical actor."
Leveraging the Peace Dimension in the Humanitarian-Development-Peace (HDP) Nexus [...],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9GDyeuoBOk,4 days ago,109 views,"## Beyond Silos: Integrating Peace as a Transformative Practice in Fragile Contexts

The discussion at the Paris Peace Forum critically examined the conceptual and practical challenges of operationalizing the Humanitarian-Development-Peace (HDP) Nexus, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. The central tension revealed was the pervasive tendency to relegate peacebuilding to a secondary or distinct pillar, rather than embedding it as a fundamental, cross-cutting practice that actively shapes and informs all humanitarian and development interventions. Panelists underscored that true effectiveness and lasting stability are contingent upon a paradigm shift: from merely delivering technical solutions to fostering deep-seated relationships, trust, and inclusive governance at every level of engagement.

Dorothee Hutter, Country Director for GIZ in Ethiopia, set the stage by emphasizing that development gains and even military successes in fragile contexts are inherently reversible unless anchored in sustainable peace. She posited that peacebuilding is not a mere ""nice-to-have"" activity but an essential driver connecting humanitarian and development efforts, crucial for unlocking resilience, inclusion, and stability. This foundational idea was expanded by Caroline Delgado of SIPRI, who argued that while delivering technical solutions (such as land restoration or water systems) is often straightforward, the far greater challenge lies in altering ""how people and institutions relate to each other."" Delgado passionately advocated for rethinking peace not as a distant goal or a passive backdrop, but as a ""continuous process"" built on trust, inclusion, solidarity, and fairness, evolving through dynamic relationships. This redefinition transforms peace into a ""way of working""—an inherent component of every decision, partnership, and program design, ensuring that interventions actively strengthen social bonds rather than exacerbate existing tensions.

Ambassador Mamman Nuhu, Executive Secretary of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, provided concrete examples from his region, where traditional practices like transhumance, while vital for livelihoods, frequently trigger conflict due to governance gaps and resource scarcity. He stressed that any effective intervention must prioritize ""inclusiveness,"" ensuring all stakeholders—from pastoralists and farmers to local authorities—are integral to planning and execution; excluding any group, particularly primary resource users, guarantees failure. To systematically integrate peacebuilding, Ambassador Nuhu proposed innovative mechanisms such as co-designing ""Peace and Corridor Compacts"" with standardized rules for resource use, establishing ""Civil-Military De-escalation Cells"" at border points for real-time dispute mediation, and creating ""Interoperable Transhumance Identity Cards"" with harmonized regulations across borders. These proposals highlight a shift towards preemptive, context-specific solutions that build trust and prevent escalation by formalizing agreements and ensuring equitable access.

Gibessa Bekonju Senbeta, founder of Development for All, brought a crucial grassroots perspective from Ethiopia, detailing the formidable challenges faced by local civil society organizations. He cited shrinking civic space, which restricts efforts to promote human rights and accountability, and the prevalence of ""siloed funding streams"" that hinder integrated programming. Senbeta also highlighted the detrimental impact of short funding cycles on long-term trust-building initiatives, coupled with a lack of institutional sustainability for local actors. Despite these hurdles, he identified significant opportunities, particularly in leveraging the ""uniquely positioned"" and locally trusted civil society organizations that can deftly navigate conflict environments. His call to strengthen and empower these local actors resonated with Eva Junyent Izquierdo, EU HDP Nexus Coordinator, who detailed the EU's Team Europe initiative in Ethiopia’s Somali region. This test case aims to overcome fragmentation by utilizing shared tools like ""HDP Profiles"" for joint context analysis, ""HDP Planning Tables"" for coordinated implementation, and a dedicated ""HDP Coordination Platform"" to bring government and community actors together, fostering a system-based approach to resilience-building.

Ultimately, the panel articulated a powerful strategic takeaway: durable peace in fragile settings cannot be externally ""delivered"" but must be organically ""built"" through an intentional, inclusive, and relationship-centric approach. This necessitates a fundamental reorientation of international engagement—moving beyond project-centric interventions to supporting adaptive, government-led coordination structures that prioritize local ownership and integrate peace considerations into the very fabric of humanitarian and development programming, thereby transforming systemic vulnerabilities into sustainable resilience."
Rethinking Investment in Peace and Security through a Feminist Lens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUmwBuWAb7Y,5 days ago,51 views,"## From Symbolic Resolutions to Systemic Change: Elevating Women's Role in Peace and Security

The 25th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, dedicated to Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), served as a poignant backdrop for a critical discussion at the Paris Peace Forum, exposing a persistent chasm between international mandates and their ground-level realization. While there is broad consensus on the imperative of women's involvement in peace, resilience, and reconstruction, the dialogue underscored a pervasive under-recognition and under-resourcing of their contributions, alongside bureaucratic rigidities and a troubling ""shrinking space"" for gender-focused initiatives. The core tension lies in translating women's acknowledged agency into an actionable, systemic framework that moves beyond symbolic gestures to genuinely empower them as indispensable architects of sustainable peace.

Speakers from diverse operational and institutional backgrounds highlighted the multifaceted nature of this challenge.

Her work in fragile contexts, exemplified by efforts in Uganda to support displaced women with tailored financial and non-financial services, underscored how localized, gender-holistic approaches, inclusive of men and institutions as support systems, drive long-term usage and stability. Such economic empowerment is directly linked to peace, as ""women who raise their children with opportunities... are less risky to expose those children to actions of terrorism, of drug dealing,"" a stark reminder of the broader societal dividends of investing in women. This perspective, further advocating for economic growth over mere resilience and for major financial institutions to invest in local organizations, challenges traditional development paradigms that often relegate women to a glass ceiling.

She asserted that the WPS agenda is fundamentally a ""security issue,"" not solely a women's issue, demanding robust political commitment beyond rhetoric, backed by clear structures and dedicated resources. Iraq's pioneering National Action Plan on 1325, initiated by 10 women's organizations, demonstrated the transformative power of local engagement in bridging grassroots activism with government actors. This participatory model, involving federal and regional governments, parliaments, and civil society, ensured the localization of priorities and fostered a unique level of accountability for implementation and reporting. Nafisatou Idé Sadou further amplified this, highlighting how women in the Sahel, often left to uphold community cohesion when men flee conflict or poverty, are increasingly politically awakened, leveraging quota laws and collective action to amplify their voices in governance and peacebuilding.

Despite progress, significant obstacles persist. Peter Wagner from the European Commission’s Foreign Policy Instruments acknowledged the EU’s commitment to the WPS agenda but conceded the ""challenge"" of ensuring high-level commitments translate into tangible impact on the ground, citing the discrepancy between quotas and lived realities. He pinpointed limitations imposed by financial regulations designed for transparency and efficiency that often hinder direct support to grassroots organizations, forcing reliance on intermediaries. However, he stressed the EU’s evolving strategy towards ""co-creation"" with local actors and aggregating projects to achieve ""critical mass"" for impact, moving beyond a ""nice anecdotal boutique grassroots level."" The overarching strategic takeaway from the discussion is that the WPS agenda requires a paradigm shift from a project-based, top-down approach to a systemic, locally-anchored investment framework that prioritizes women's agency and economic empowerment. This necessitates a more flexible and trusting relationship between international donors and local organizations, a sustained focus on development alongside humanitarian response, and a concerted effort to counter the shrinking space for civil society to ensure that peace and security efforts are genuinely inclusive and sustainable.

The 25th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, dedicated to Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), served as a poignant backdrop for a critical discussion at the Paris Peace Forum, exposing a persistent chasm between international mandates and their ground-level realization. While there is broad consensus on the imperative of women's involvement in peace, resilience, and reconstruction, the dialogue underscored a pervasive under-recognition and under-resourcing of their contributions, alongside bureaucratic rigidities and a troubling ""shrinking space"" for gender-focused initiatives. The core tension lies in translating women's acknowledged agency into an actionable, systemic framework that moves beyond symbolic gestures to genuinely empower them as indispensable architects of sustainable peace.

Ending the War against Ukraine: Building Pathways to Peace and Recovery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEIC1h9oz5M,5 days ago,124 views,"## Peace Through Strength: Forging a Durable European Security Paradigm in the Face of Russian Aggression

The Paris Peace Forum convened a critical discussion on ""Peace and Security in Ukraine: Ending the War and Rebuilding a Secure Europe,"" revealing a robust, albeit complex, consensus among key European allies regarding the imperative of Ukrainian victory and the re-architecting of continental security. The panel underscored a collective commitment to confronting Russia's aggressive posture through sustained support for Kyiv and enhanced deterrence capabilities, thereby cementing a ""peace through strength"" doctrine as the bedrock of future stability. A primary tension emerged between the immediate cessation of hostilities and the strategic necessity of establishing a just, comprehensive, and enduring peace, fundamentally questioning the viability of diplomacy absent decisive battlefield outcomes.

Oleksandr Mishenko, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, set an unequivocal tone, framing Russia's aggression as an ""existential threat"" to Ukraine and a direct challenge to the global rules-based order. He asserted that a ""just and lasting peace"" hinges on ""political will to defend peace without appeasement"" and a robust security architecture, explicitly calling for increased military aid, including long-range rockets, to enable Ukraine to ""fight with Russian occupational army."" Mishenko’s appeal for accountability, including the use of frozen Russian assets for reconstruction and a tribunal for war crimes, highlighted Ukraine's rejection of any notion of diplomatic compromise that would legitimize Russia's territorial gains or undermine Ukrainian sovereignty. This perspective resonated with Baiba Braze, Latvia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, who unequivocally stated, ""Our problem is not Ukraine... it's the Russian war."" Braze emphasized Russia's imperialistic tendencies and its willingness to use force for political objectives, advocating for significant investment in ""hard defense capabilities"" including nuclear deterrence, and unwavering support for Ukraine, noting Latvia's contribution of 1% of its GDP. Both speakers underscored that a genuine peace can only be achieved when Russia abandons its aggressive policy, signaling a strong skepticism towards immediate diplomatic overtures.

The discussions moved beyond immediate military support to explore the broader strategic implications for European security and the challenges of sustaining collective action. Peter Wagner, Director of the Foreign Policy Instrument for the European Commission, acknowledged the monumental financial commitments from the EU—totaling over 180 billion euros—and the ongoing work to translate these resources into effective military and reconstruction aid. He highlighted the unique legal and financial complexities surrounding the potential use of frozen Russian assets, a measure leaders are committed to exploring to ensure long-term support for Ukraine's rebuilding. Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for European Affairs, further articulated France's proactive stance within the ""coalition of the willing,"" emphasizing the need for ""material, not just rhetorical"" security guarantees for Ukraine. He addressed the controversial but strategic consideration of deploying European contingents to Ukraine, not necessarily as combat troops, but as a deterrent to bolster a ceasefire and provide tangible security, acknowledging the significant message this sends to Moscow despite its predictable condemnation. This multifaceted approach illustrates a shift in the European mindset from reactive responses to a more integrated and proactive security posture.

Despite a shared commitment to strengthening Ukraine and deterring Russia, the pathway to diplomatic engagement with Moscow remains deeply contested and distant. Braze explicitly dismissed the current environment as conducive to meaningful diplomacy, pointing to Russia's consistent violation of international norms and agreements, from the Budapest Memorandum to the Minsk Accords. She highlighted Russia’s broader ""warfare doctrine"" which employs non-conventional means—corruption, cyberattacks, disinformation, and even assassinations—to destabilize democracies across Europe, arguing that these tactics necessitate a robust, unified, and long-term counter-strategy. Haddad concurred that any future diplomatic resolution would only emerge from a position of strength, effectively negating Russia's current maximalist demands. The panel implicitly recognized that Russia's denial of Ukrainian identity and its ambition to dismantle the post-Cold War security order represent a fundamental ideological conflict that cannot be resolved through conventional negotiations alone. The current consensus is that only when Moscow perceives a decisive military and economic disadvantage, through sustained Western pressure and Ukrainian resilience, might it genuinely consider meaningful diplomatic concessions for a truly comprehensive and lasting peace.

The Paris Peace Forum panel articulated a new European security paradigm rooted in unwavering support for Ukraine and robust deterrence against Russia, recognizing the war as an existential challenge to the rules-based international order. The strategic implication is a profound and irreversible commitment by Europe to invest in its collective defense, transform its industrial base, and coordinate a comprehensive strategy of military, financial, and diplomatic pressure. While the path to a durable peace remains complex, it is firmly anchored in the belief that only a decisive demonstration of strength and unity will compel Moscow towards a just settlement, ensuring not only Ukraine's future but also the long-term stability of the European continent."
Securing the Digital Commons and High-Risk Actors: Operational Launch of the Common Good Cyber Fund,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR7qGLhS_EI,5 days ago,18 views,"## A Unified Front Against Digital Transnational Repression: The Common Good Cyber Fund as a Collective Imperative

The escalating sophistication and pervasive reach of digital transnational repression pose an existential threat to civil society, democratic institutions, and the very fabric of global interconnectedness. While non-profit organizations striving to protect vulnerable internet users and safeguard civic space find themselves increasingly targeted, their efforts have often been fragmented and severely underfunded. The Common Good Cyber Fund (CGCF) emerges as a vital, multi-stakeholder mechanism designed to consolidate these disparate defenses, transforming a reactive and isolated struggle into a unified, proactive front against an insidious digital foe.

The threat emanating from hostile states is systemic, calculated, and persistent, utilizing cyber operations not merely to disrupt systems but to fundamentally undermine democratic foundations. Ambassador Stéphane Dion underscored this, highlighting how transnational repression extends governments' coercive reach beyond their borders to intimidate, silence, or harm individuals abroad, with digital footprints now replacing physical proximity. Statistics from Freedom House, cited by Ambassador Dion, reveal that a quarter of the world's governments employ such tactics, with just ten nations, notably China and Russia, responsible for nearly 80% of direct incidents between 2014 and 2024. Andrew Dalgleish reinforced this, noting that NGOs and think tanks ranked among the top three most targeted sectors globally, despite their critical role in safeguarding democratic resilience. This digital weaponization, leveraging surveillance, spyware, AI-driven disinformation, and deep fakes, erodes free expression, civic participation, and trust in governance, thereby diminishing national sovereignty and challenging the integrity of democracies.

In response to this urgent and growing challenge, the Common Good Cyber Initiative was born in July 2023, catalyzed by the recognized vulnerabilities and fragmented efforts of cybersecurity non-profits. Kaeli Giraud outlined the initiative's three core missions: rigorous research into existing civil society cybersecurity efforts, active capability building among non-profits to prevent duplication and foster joint fundraising, and critical coordination among donors to secure sustainable funding. The subsequent launch of the Common Good Cyber Fund, with foundational support from Canada and the UK, and endorsed by G7 leaders at Kananaskis, signifies a pivotal shift towards collective defense. Administered by the Internet Society with strategic oversight from the Global Cyber Alliance, the Fund aims to deliver enhanced protection for high-risk civil society actors, enable earlier detection of malign activities, bolster cybersecurity infrastructure at scale, and disrupt hostile operations, thus transforming fragmented efforts into a unified defensive network.

The potency of the CGCF transcends mere financial provision, resting fundamentally on its commitment to fostering robust relationships and leveraging a broad spectrum of expertise. Christopher Locke emphasized that the Fund embodies a ""whole-of-society effort,"" demanding the ingenuity of the private sector, the empirical rigor of academia, and the unwavering advocacy of civil society, alongside governmental commitment. The establishment of a strong advisory committee, comprising donors and cybersecurity experts, ensures that granting strategies remain agile and responsive to the rapidly evolving threat landscape, as highlighted by Locke. Furthermore, non-financial contributions are vital, exemplified by The Hague’s ""Cyber Secure The Hague"" program, which provides crucial in-kind support and expertise to non-profits, as articulated by Deputy Mayor Saskia Bruines. Stéphane Duguin, reflecting on the project's journey from initial skepticism, underscored that its unexpected success is a testament to the power of collective action and the unique coalition of civil society organizations that refused to let the initiative fail.

The strategic implication of the Common Good Cyber Fund's emergence is profound: it signals an unwavering international commitment to counter digital transnational repression, recognizing it as a shared vulnerability that demands a unified, comprehensive response. By consolidating resources and expertise across governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector, the Fund not only provides critical protection to those most at risk but also strengthens the very foundations of global democratic security. Its success will demonstrate that, even in an era of complex digital threats, a collective will for a safe, accountable, and dignified digital future can indeed prevail."
Disinformation and Democratic Resilience: Tools for Countering Digital Threats,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw_lYlfmGnA,5 days ago,67 views,"## The AI Paradox: Confronting Disinformation's Existential Threat to Democratic Trust with Fragmented Fortunes and a Disputed Future

The Paris Peace Forum's roundtable on ""Disinformation and Democratic Resilience"" unveiled a stark landscape: artificial intelligence, far from being a neutral tool, has dramatically amplified digital threats, fundamentally eroding public trust and the very fabric of democratic societies. Expert consensus quickly converged on the notion that the core challenge is not merely technological, but an insidious assault on the social contract itself, rendered exponentially more potent by AI's cost-efficiency, speed, and capacity for hyper-targeted, emotive manipulation. This discussion underscored a critical dichotomy: while innovative solutions are emerging, they grapple with under-resourced civic actors, a pervasive lack of a unified positive vision for the digital space, and the alarming weaponization of legislative frameworks, even in democratic contexts.

Christopher Locke from the Internet Society Foundation articulated that genuine trust on the internet stems from user participation and ownership, yet AI introduces a ""compound disengagement."" Large Language Models (LLMs), often trained on biased data, amplify existing regional prejudices within social media platforms. This systemic flaw, as Svetlana Zilianoska of Metamorphosis Foundation emphasized, enables AI to ""over-flood"" the information sphere with such volume and velocity that traditional anti-disinformation efforts are overwhelmed, rendering them incapable of even tracking, let alone effectively countering, malicious narratives before societal damage is incurred. Jihad Bitar of Siren Analytics further elucidated this, describing how social media algorithms, by design, prioritize content that elicits strong sentiment, creating a self-reinforcing ""bad loop"" where AI-generated disinformation thrives on and exacerbates internal tensions, profoundly disrupting the fundamental trust inherent to democratic processes.

Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation highlighted a critical vulnerability: while platforms like Wikipedia serve as foundational training data for many LLMs, their reliability ultimately rests on the integrity of primary sources—journalists, scientists, and independent researchers. These vital ""communities of practice,"" she warned, are under unprecedented threat, facing economic precarity, public discreditation via propaganda, and direct physical harm from state and non-state actors. Stéphane Duguin from the Cyberpeace Institute corroborated this, noting that civil society organizations, humanitarian workers, and climate change advocates are disproportionately targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks and information operations due to their perceived vulnerability and often limited cybersecurity budgets. This multi-pronged assault on the creators and curators of trusted information risks replacing fact-based knowledge with what MacKinnon termed ""AI-slop and propaganda,"" jeopardizing the very epistemological basis for democratic deliberation.

The roundtable starkly revealed that technological innovation alone cannot stem the tide without robust policy frameworks and dedicated funding. Duguin detailed the Cyberpeace Institute's work providing free digital resilience to non-profits, underscoring that the existing ""competitive market"" for cybersecurity talent makes it impossible for under-resourced civil society to attract the necessary expertise. Bitar added that AI has dramatically reduced the cost of disinformation, enabling highly targeted campaigns that fatigue populations and deepen local divisions. MacKinnon critiqued a global policy landscape driven by reactive problem-solving (e.g., child protection, crime fighting) rather than a proactive, positive vision for internet governance. She cited the UK's Online Safety Act and the UN Cybercrime Convention as examples where well-intentioned legislation, without thorough human rights safeguards, risks mandating surveillance and identity verification that could be weaponized against civic actors, inadvertently stifling the very open knowledge platforms they aim to protect. This reveals a critical failure to adequately invest in and coherently support the digital ecosystem's positive agents.

The strategic implication is clear: countering AI-driven disinformation requires a radical shift from fragmented, reactive defense to a comprehensive, ""whole-of-society"" offensive. This necessitates not only significant, coordinated investment from states and philanthropies into civic cybersecurity and proactive ""pre-bunking"" strategies but also a fundamental re-evaluation of global internet governance to champion a positive vision that prioritizes trust, user ownership, and the protection of those who generate and disseminate reliable information, lest the digital public sphere succumb entirely to engineered chaos."
Empower Her: Championing Women who Shape Policies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lmc-ZgjToM,5 days ago,93 views,"## Feminist Diplomacy Under Siege: The Urgent Call for Courage and Cohesion in Global Women's Leadership

The discourse surrounding women's role in global governance, though increasingly vocal, remains fraught with profound challenges and disheartening reversals. Introduced by Trisha Shetty, the stark reality of declining female representation at the helm of governments—a regression from 23.3% in 2024 to 22.9% in 2025, according to UN Women data—immediately underscored the panel's central tension. This is not merely a statistical anomaly but a critical imperative for sustained action, demanding a shift from descriptive reporting to a proactive strategy that integrates women into every facet of policy-making to navigate crises effectively. The expert panel convened to dissect the multifaceted barriers and strategic pathways for women’s enduring impact, revealing a consensus on the need for systemic change, resilience against backlash, and a reimagining of global cooperation.

The perceived erosion of faith in international institutions and the vilification of gender-focused policies present a formidable macro-level challenge. Michelle Milford Morse of the UN Foundation deftly reframed the ""loss of faith,"" distinguishing between those reliant on humanitarian aid (who retain trust) and policymakers scrutinizing institutional redundancies and budgetary constraints. This internal critique, she argued, necessitates a fundamental reform rooted in member states listening to their populace and the UN actively welcoming civil society engagement, rather than closing its doors. Echoing this sentiment, France's Minister Delegate, Eléonore Caroït, firmly articulated that feminist diplomacy is not a Western imposition but a universal prerequisite for achieving peace, sound economies, and effective governance, especially amidst growing global skepticism towards gender-inclusive language. Countering the prevailing narrative of stagnation, Linda Rama highlighted Albania's remarkable strides in achieving over 50% female representation in cabinet and public administration, attributing this success directly to the implementation of quotas and sustained civil society pressure, demonstrating that decisive policy levers, when coupled with political will, yield tangible results.

Translating macro aspirations into tangible local impact necessitates confronting profound structural barriers and fostering robust, grassroots empowerment. Matt Reed from the Aga Khan Foundation elucidated a century-long institutional commitment to women's participation, emphasizing their bottom-up approach through 60,000 community organizations, half of which are women-led, across fragile regions. He underscored that ""liberating women's potential"" fundamentally requires addressing time poverty imposed by tasks like fetching water, necessitating investment in basic infrastructure. Jackie Jones of the Gates Foundation further distilled the strategic elements for women’s advancement: safe spaces, essential care infrastructure for all genders, and robust sponsorship/mentorship networks, which enable women to ""be what they cannot see."" These foundational elements, supported by strategic engagement through modern entertainment and media channels, are critical for bridging the gap between policy intent and lived reality, particularly for adolescent girls and youth.

The contemporary political landscape demands not just access to power, but the sustained fortitude to reclaim narratives and withstand pervasive attacks. Huma Abedin emphasized that in an era where politics demands a ""thick skin,"" women disproportionately face personal, online, and sexual harassment, necessitating adaptive strategies. Her call to ""not let untruths stand"" underscores the imperative to actively counter misinformation and hostile narratives, a battle fought with strategic communication and the amplification of positive stories. Pedro Abramovay of Open Society Foundations positioned women as the indispensable bulwark against global democratic erosion, showcasing how female politicians worldwide are innovating governance through ""care-centric"" policies and how women's participation in peace negotiations (e.g., Yemen) brings tangible results. This push for women's leadership, he argued, requires a network-centric approach, fostering collective resilience against individual challenges. Ultimately, the panel’s collective message resonated: navigating this complex terrain demands not just legislative changes and institutional reforms, but a profound shift in cultural narratives, persistent advocacy, and an unwavering commitment to women’s equal right to shape the future.

Despite significant headwinds—from institutional skepticism and patriarchal backlash to active conflict and structural inequalities—the panel converged on a strategic imperative: sustained, courageous action. The path forward demands multi-faceted engagement, bottom-up empowerment, deliberate policy interventions (like quotas and universal care infrastructure), and a relentless commitment to shaping narratives that champion women's rightful place at every table. This collective push for ""courage"" and ""action"" is not merely about achieving numerical parity, but about fundamentally improving governance, fostering peace, and realizing a more equitable, resilient future for all."
Conflict Transformation & Community Resilience: Building Trust through Livelihoods and Dialogue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l44J78OVSd8,5 days ago,132 views,"## The Architecture of Trust: Grassroots Innovation in Conflict Transformation

The conventional wisdom that peace must be actively constructed, not merely hoped for, served as the foundational premise for a recent panel discussion at the Paris Peace Forum. Convened under the theme of ""Conflict Transformation and Community Resilience,"" the session transcended typical policy discourse to explore practical, bottom-up methodologies for cultivating trust and social cohesion in some of the world's most volatile regions. The overarching revelation was a compelling articulation of how deliberate, often unconventional, local engagements can lay robust groundwork for stability, even in contexts where direct political dialogue remains elusive or impossible. This diverse panel, representing initiatives from Afghanistan to Israel-Palestine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Germany, collectively illuminated the ""secret sauce"" of peacebuilding: transforming everyday conflicts into opportunities for collective action and mutual understanding, thereby bridging the chasm between grand political aspirations and lived realities.

Initiatives in Afghanistan, presented by Sultan Abbas of the Aga Khan Foundation and Elaha Eli Omar of Uplift Afghanistan Fund, underscored the imperative of local-level empowerment. Abbas detailed the ""Omid"" project, which identifies granular triggers of violence, such as disputes over water resources or grazing lands, and addresses them through intracommunal dialogue. By training community members in pluralism and conflict resolution, and subsequently providing micro-grants for shared practical projects like cleaning irrigation canals, the project fostered collaboration among previously adversarial ethnic groups. Eli Omar further elaborated on this community-driven paradigm, emphasizing that Uplift Afghanistan, an Afghan and female-led entity, partners with Community Development Councils across the country. Her poignant observation from Solang, where a water canal reconstruction project was underway, was that the ""social repair""—the renewed dignity, purpose, and sense of belonging derived from collective effort—far outweighed the physical infrastructure repair. Both speakers affirmed that rebuilding trust fundamentally starts with and must be led by the very people affected, challenging state-centric approaches by demonstrating that resilience is built from the ground up through shared ownership and management of solutions.

The formidable challenge of sustained conflict, particularly in the Israeli-Palestinian context, was addressed by Rula Hardal and Yael Berda of ""A Land For All."" Their political vision advocates for an end to conflict, not mere management, and a framework built on principles of equality, recognition, and reconciliation. Berda articulated a bold solution: ""Two states to end the occupation, one homeland to end the conflict."" This entails two fully sovereign states along 1967 borders with shared Jerusalem, but crucially, guaranteeing freedom of movement and residence for both Israelis and Palestinians throughout the entire homeland, without displacement or loss of rights. This framework aims to dismantle zero-sum mentalities by establishing joint institutions for shared resources like water, environmental management, and security, thereby reframing a conflict of ""belonging"" into a mutual future where freedom and security are intrinsically linked. This ambitious vision provides a critical political anchor, offering a hopeful alternative to existing power dynamics and expanding the imaginative space for practical cooperation.

Complementing these perspectives, Bienfait Mugenza of Congo Peace Academy and Imke Kerber of Pro Peace in Germany offered insights into practical peacebuilding techniques. Mugenza, drawing from his personal experience of narrowly escaping rebel violence, highlighted the profound trauma prevalent in Eastern Congo. His organization utilizes conservation agriculture, teaching sustainable farming techniques (like ""no-tillage"" and composting), to bring together individuals from fractured communities. By designing agricultural projects that necessitate groups to collaborate, the program builds relationships and trust through shared labor, leading to increased yields and enabling dialogue on sensitive issues previously deemed intractable. Kerber described Pro Peace's ""Local Conflict Counselling"" approach in Germany, which also emphasizes system thinking to address conflicts non-violently. By conducting extensive situation analyses and facilitating dialogue, they empower local actors—both state and civil society—to find their own solutions, rather than imposing external ones. This process, often involving lengthy conversations to ensure every voice is heard, aims to change behaviors, improve structures, and rebuild trust by highlighting existing capacities and fostering a forward-looking perspective.

The strategic implication across these diverse experiences is that authentic, sustainable peace is not solely brokered at negotiating tables or imposed by external powers. It is an emergent property of concerted, community-level efforts that cultivate mutual understanding, economic cooperation, and shared ownership of common problems. By reframing ""pluralism"" and ""political vision"" into tangible, achievable joint projects—whether it is an irrigation canal, a joint governance structure for shared resources, or a collective farming initiative—these approaches demonstrate that trust is not a precondition for engagement but a *product* of it. The path to lasting stability in conflict-affected regions, therefore, hinges on empowering local actors to construct their own architectures of trust, one collaborative brick at a time."
"Forging the Future: A Dialogue on Beneficial AI for Children, Starting with Principles",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obs-Lo_4kCw,5 days ago,125 views,"## AI and Childhood: A Call for Deliberate Co-creation Amidst Rapid Technological Advance

The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence presents both profound opportunities and unprecedented challenges for the developmental trajectory of children globally. A recent panel discussion, convened under the aegis of the iRAISE (International Research-Driven Alliance for AI Serving Every Child) initiative at the Paris Peace Forum, starkly underscored the urgent imperative to address AI’s impact on this vulnerable demographic. The central tension animating the discourse was the critical need to balance AI's transformative potential with its significant, often subtle, risks, demanding a globally inclusive, research-driven, and multi-stakeholder governance framework implemented with deliberate speed. The panel revealed a consensus that unlike previous technological revolutions, waiting decades for impact assessment is no longer an option; proactive, ethical co-creation is paramount.

The discussion illuminated specific risks inherent in AI's interaction with developing minds. Mathilde Collin, a lead researcher from iRAISE, detailed preliminary lab findings identifying ""model behaviors"" as key influencers of AI’s impact. Critically, AI employing ""relational cues""—such as claiming friendship or exclusive support—was deemed the *riskiest with the lowest benefits*, fostering inappropriate attachments with developing adolescents highly sensitive to social cues and reward systems. Ludvig Charlet, a youth advocate, offered a candid personal testimony, confessing his generation's widespread ""over-reliance"" on AI for communication and even critical tasks, acknowledging that ""it's easier not to think sometimes."" This anecdotal insight resonates with Laurence Devillers’ scientific findings from Sorbonne/CNRS, which cited an MIT study suggesting AI use can significantly reduce cognitive engagement, potentially leading to ""cognitive atrophy"" and diminished brain plasticity—a dire prospect for long-term development. The vulnerability of children, particularly adolescents, to anthropomorphic AI (AI feigning emotions or physical sensations) that increases its perceived ""humanness,"" was also a significant concern, posing unquantified challenges to their socio-emotional wiring.

Despite these grave concerns, speakers articulated a strong vision for AI's beneficial applications, emphasizing its potential for individualized learning and even enhancing critical thinking, provided it is designed ""for us and with us."" This duality underscores the ethical design challenge at the heart of the debate: how to leverage AI's capabilities to optimize childhood experience rather than merely accelerating technological adoption. Lauren from OpenAI stressed the ""need for speed"" in understanding AI's impact, coupled with an unwavering commitment to ""safety as the number one priority"" for teenagers. Cloe Felder from Google elaborated on decades of experience in designing child-safe products, advocating for continuous ""red-teaming"" and iterative safeguards, built on evidence and collaboration. This collective drive to ""race to the top"" in ethical AI development reflects a growing industry recognition that responsible innovation is not a voluntary endeavor but an essential precondition for widespread, long-term acceptance.

Translating these aspirational goals into actionable policy and practice requires unprecedented collaboration and global outreach, a core tenet of the iRAISE coalition. Eriklie Barritch from the UN highlighted the organization's role in amplifying research and guiding member states, while also raising a critical concern: approximately 50% of countries globally lack foundational digital or AI strategies, with some policymakers themselves unfamiliar with generative AI. This stark reality underscores a significant disconnect between rapid technological advancement and global governance capacity, making multi-stakeholder partnerships and the inclusion of Global South voices—as passionately advocated by Nagla Rizek—indispensable for ensuring equitable and context-aware solutions. UNICEF's Cécile emphasized that ""we don't know that much"" about how children use AI, advocating for robust, context-specific research to fill these ""blatant gaps"" in understanding. This collective call for a ""dialogue,"" rather than unilateral prescriptions, reflects a nuanced understanding that no single entity possesses all the answers to the complex questions posed by AI's future.

In conclusion, the discourse converged on a singular, powerful message: addressing AI's impact on children is not a voluntary initiative but a shared moral and strategic imperative. The urgency stems from AI's unprecedented speed and pervasive reach, demanding proactive, research-backed policy and design. The panel's call for deliberate co-creation across governments, industry, academia, civil society, and importantly, with children themselves, aims to ""race to the top"" in establishing ethical standards. This integrated approach, rooted in a fundamental commitment to children's rights and human well-being, is crucial for shaping a future where AI genuinely supports, rather than compromises, the development of the next generation.

How can we Protect Science so that Science can Protect Us?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr57UyEFlDY,5 days ago,51 views,"## Rebuilding Faith in the Factual: Bridging Science and Society in an Era of Distrust and Disruption

The contemporary global landscape is marked by a profound erosion of public trust in institutions, with science finding itself increasingly caught in the crossfire. A recent discussion among experts, diplomats, and policymakers at the Paris Peace Forum underscored this critical juncture, advocating for a radical re-evaluation of how scientific knowledge is generated, disseminated, and integrated into societal discourse. The overarching thesis that emerged was the urgent imperative for the scientific community to move beyond its traditional confines, embracing proactive engagement, radical transparency, and a clear articulation of its fundamental value to navigate an increasingly fragmented and misinformed world.

The core of the challenge, as articulated by Raj Kumar of Devex, lies in a pervasive public skepticism that often conflates science with elitist institutions. Gilles Bloch, President of the National Museum of Natural History, starkly warned that science is ""not safe,"" recounting a cyberattack on his institution as a tangible manifestation of this vulnerability. He contended that the academic sphere, as a symbol of freedom and education, has become a deliberate target for those hostile to scientific inquiry. Bloch’s pivotal insight was that science cannot afford to be defensive; its strength lies in its inherent openness and the sharing of knowledge. He critically attributed the current societal distrust to a historical failure over the last two to three decades to adequately share scientific findings with the broader public. The proposed remedy champions an increased commitment from educational and research institutions to foster deeper connections with society, notably through leveraging digital communication to render complex science accessible to all, recognizing that an informed populace is crucial for democratic decision-making.

This call for engagement found powerful resonance in concrete, actionable examples. Hicham El Habti, President of the University Mohammed VI Polytechnic, showcased a model where community connection is embedded in the institution's DNA. He detailed how UM6P directly supports farmers in drought-stricken Moroccan regions by co-developing and implementing new, resilient crops like quinoa, embodying ""science in the lab and in the field."" Beyond agriculture, the university's outreach includes ""Science"" initiatives that bring hundreds of young people to labs, and a popular national TV show, ""Science and Civilizations,"" which engages a million viewers. Ma Jun, from the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, offered a compelling case study from China, detailing how a ""total transparency initiative"" transformed public perception of air pollution data. By compelling hourly disclosure of emissions and developing a ""Blue Map"" mobile app to visualize non-compliant polluters, his work empowered citizen action, leading to a dramatic reduction in key pollutants and, crucially, rebuilding trust where official data was once disbelieved. These examples underscore that science’s tangible impact, directly addressing people's immediate concerns, is the most potent antidote to skepticism.

The discussion also highlighted critical sectors facing intense anti-science sentiment, notably health and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence. Sandrine Bouttier-Stref of Sanofi underscored that health is the ""bullseye"" of anti-science campaigns, with the COVID-19 pandemic unfortunately catalyzing a surge in anti-vaccine and anti-medicine narratives. She stressed that while biopharma relies on rigorous science to save lives, rebuilding trust necessitates transparency, rigor, and an honest acknowledgment of what remains unknown. Crucially, she linked environmental degradation to public health, emphasizing the need for science to unravel complex interactions, such as why rising temperatures exacerbate diabetes. Kiara Nirghin, co-founder of Chima, extended this perspective to AI, portraying it as a disruptive force that will profoundly reshape the workforce and public engagement with information. While AI offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation and efficiency, it simultaneously introduces new vectors for misinformation and widespread job displacement, generating fresh skepticism that the scientific community must preemptively address.

Ultimately, the panel coalesced around the broader, often overlooked, role of science in shaping better societies and fostering collective intelligence. Michael Obersteiner from the University of Oxford argued that science's function must extend beyond merely solving technical problems to actively informing how societies organize themselves and navigate global challenges. He evoked the spirit of the Enlightenment, suggesting that a compartmentalized view of science weakens its societal influence. Benoît Mirabel, President of the One Sustainable Health for All Foundation, reinforced this, emphasizing a ""One Health"" approach that connects human, animal, and planetary health. He advocated for a renewed, inclusive dialogue with civil society, grounded in scientific credibility and open debate, as essential for tackling complex threats like antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which, though not yet a public rallying cry, poses an existential threat to modern medicine.

The strategic implication of this discussion is clear: science stands at a pivotal juncture where its very utility and legitimacy are questioned. Rebuilding public trust requires a proactive, multi-faceted strategy that moves beyond academic silos. It demands transparent and accessible communication, direct engagement with communities to demonstrate tangible benefits, and a willingness to address the nuanced complexities of scientific findings without resorting to oversimplification. Furthermore, it necessitates a renewed philosophical grounding for science, one that emphasizes its indispensable role not just in problem-solving, but in fostering a more informed, resilient, and collectively intelligent global society. Ignoring these challenges risks not only the progress of science but the well-being of the planet itself.

"Oceans at the Crossroads of Biodiversity, Climate, and Security Issues",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AETNtlnNWoA,5 days ago,64 views,"## The Ocean at a Crossroads: Intertwined Crises, Fragmented Responses, and the Imperative for Holistic Governance

The global oceans, covering 70% of the Earth’s surface, are no longer a peripheral concern but stand at the nexus of interlocking geopolitical, environmental, and security crises. A recent panel discussion at the Paris Peace Forum, featuring experts from military, scientific, and geopolitical spheres, underscored the profound interconnectedness of climate change, biodiversity loss, and international relations through the lens of oceanic health. The central tension articulated was the urgent need for comprehensive global cooperation and enhanced scientific understanding, juxtaposed against an alarming trend of geopolitical fragmentation and a prevailing underestimation of the ocean's criticality, threatening both ecological stability and human security.

Admiral Christophe Prazuck, Director of the Ocean Institute at Sorbonne University, framed the discussion by positing three interwoven global crises: climate change, biodiversity erosion, and a breakdown in multilateral international relations. He asserted that the ocean is the critical arena where these crises converge, with climate change actively warming, acidifying, and deoxygenating marine environments, thereby transforming the physical characteristics of this vast ecosystem. This, in turn, exacerbates biodiversity loss, adding to existing pressures from pollution and overexploitation. The implications are tangible and immediate: species migration and disappearance lead to increased competition for dwindling fishing resources, escalating into ""naval battles"" in regions like the Gulf of Guinea and the South China Sea, impacting the livelihoods of millions. Furthermore, extreme weather events fueled by climate change, such as hurricanes and typhoons, inflict irreparable damage on coastal communities and small island nations, potentially leading to state fragility and collapse, illustrating that a planet merely 4°C warmer is effectively ""uninsurable"" and ""irreparable.""

Julia Tas, Head of the Ocean Program at IFRI, elaborated on the ocean's crucial, yet often underestimated, role as a climate regulator, distributing heat across the globe. She emphasized that an improved understanding of this complex circulation system reveals the profound impact human activities have on global atmospheric and oceanic balance. Critically, she highlighted that traditionally siloed fields — environmental science, socio-economics, and geopolitics — are inextricably linked through the marine environment. The perception of marine spaces as ""peripheral"" in geopolitical analyses creates a dangerous void of knowledge and breeds uncertainty. Tas noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified nine global climate tipping points, many of which are oceanic (e.g., coral reef collapse, polar ice melt, and the potential disruption of major ocean circulation patterns), underscoring the direct threat these changes pose to regional and global stability. Her work at IRFI and the Climate and Environment Observatory focuses precisely on bridging these gaps, translating scientific data into actionable insights for defence and foreign policy.

Captain Jérôme Chardon of the French Ministry of Armed Forces detailed the military's evolving role across three levels: immediate reaction to natural disasters, anticipation of illicit maritime activities, and long-term adaptation to oceanic changes. He provided examples of naval interventions in response to extreme weather events (like Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean and earthquakes in the South Pacific), emphasizing the military's capacity to deliver humanitarian aid and restore state functions. Beyond disaster response, the armed forces are increasingly engaged in combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which accounts for up to 40% of catches in some regions and destabilizes local economies. This broader mandate necessitates enhanced international cooperation, improved data sharing (e.g., through EU-led programs like CRIMARIO), and specialized training to protect marine environments. Chardon also introduced the ""Kiwi-kaka"" project, a unique initiative in French Polynesia involving the tracking of seabirds to develop an early warning system for unusual natural phenomena, showcasing an innovative approach to anticipation. Cyrille Poirier Coulansais, from the Naval Strategic Studies Centre, reinforced the severity of overfishing, with 35% of global fish stocks now overexploited, and noted that one in five fish consumed globally originates from IUU fishing—a significant portion attributable to extra-regional fleets. He also pointed to a transformative ""tipping point"" in ocean knowledge, driven by new technologies like drones, satellites, and artificial intelligence, which promises unprecedented data collection and monitoring capabilities.

The panel also addressed the broader geopolitical implications, particularly concerning deep-sea mining and the governance of polar regions. The prospect of deep-sea mining, although currently uneconomical for major players, raises significant environmental concerns, with the French President notably advocating for its prohibition. The impending renegotiation of the Antarctic Treaty Protocol in 2047, which currently designates the continent as a scientific reserve, carries the risk of renewed territorial claims and potential military exploitation, threatening a region critical for global climate regulation. A strong emphasis was placed on the need for updated international laws and enhanced enforcement mechanisms to protect these vulnerable zones. Concerns were voiced regarding the ""disengagement"" of traditional actors, such as the United States, from international climate and ocean governance initiatives, and the potential for new powers, like China, to fill these voids, leading to shifts in global influence and a possible reorientation of international scientific and security cooperation.

The discussion concluded with a powerful call for collective action grounded in robust scientific data. While the challenges are immense and interconnected, experts highlighted the inherent resilience of marine ecosystems and the transformative potential of new technologies. However, this demands a concerted global effort, transcending national interests and fostering genuine multilateralism. The strategic implication is clear: the future of global security and human well-being is inextricably linked to the health and governance of our oceans. Ignoring this reality, or allowing geopolitical competition to further fragment international cooperation, guarantees a future of intensified resource conflicts, environmental catastrophe, and increased global instability."
